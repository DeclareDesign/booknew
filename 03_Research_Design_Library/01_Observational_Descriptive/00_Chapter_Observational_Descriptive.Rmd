# Observational designs for descriptive inference

An observational design for descriptive inference has a inquiry like a population mean, covariance, or distribution as the main research goal. In an observational research design, the data strategy includes sampling and measurement components, but no treatments are allocated. Put differently, in an observational design for descriptive inference, researchers seek to measure and summarize the world, but not to change it. This class of research design encompasses a huge portion of research activity -- most surveys fall into this class, as do large-scale data collections of economic and sociopolitical indicators. Other examples of observational designs for descriptive inference include classic case studies focused on "thick description" and many text analysis projects.
