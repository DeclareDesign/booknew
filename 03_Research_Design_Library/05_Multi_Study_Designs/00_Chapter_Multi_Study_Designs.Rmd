# Multi-study designs

In the designs we presented thus far, each design represents a single "study." One set of observations was collected about one set of units. Many social science papers, however, present the results from multiple analyses from multiple data strategies. In this section, we consider declaring and diagnosing multi-study designs. The key addition in each case will be a function that summarizes the results across components of the study.
