## Conjoint experiments

Conjoint survey experiments have become hugely popular in political science and beyond for studying multidimensional choice [@Hainmueller2014]. In the common "forced-choice" design variant, subjects are presented with a choice task: a pair of profiles (of candidates, of immigrants, of policies) and are asked to make a binary choice between them.  

When you're designing a conjoint, you have to make (at least) three choices:

1. The number of **attributes**
2. The number of **levels** within each attribute
3. The number of **choice tasks** ask subjects to rate.

The right number of **attributes** is governed by the "masking/satisficing" tradeoff [@bansak_hainmueller_hopkins_yamamoto_2019]. If you don't include an important attribute (like partisanship in a candidate choice experiment), you're worried that subjects will partially infer partisanship from other attributes (like race or gender). If so, partisanship is "masked", and the estimates for the effects of race or gender will be biased by this "omitted variable." But if you add too many attributes in order to avoid masking, you may induce "satisficing" among subjects, whereby they only take in a little bit of information, enough to make a "good enough" choice among the candidates.

The right number of **levels** is governed by your sample size. If an attribute has three levels, it's like you're conducting a three-arm trial, so you'll want to have enough subjects for each arm. The more levels, the lower the power.

The right number of **choice tasks** depends on your survey budget. You can always add more pairs of profiles and the only cost is the opportunity cost of asking a different question of the survey that may serve some higher scientific purpose.  If you're worried that respondents will get bored with the task, you can always throw out profile pairs that come later in the survey. @bansak2018number suggest that you can ask many pairs without much loss of data quality.

### Declaration

```{r}
# applies the function to each pair
Y_function <- function(data) {
  data %>%
    group_by(pair) %>%
    mutate(Y = if_else(E == max(E), 1, 0)) %>%
    ungroup
}
design <- 
  declare_population(
    subject = add_level(N = 500),
    pair = add_level(N = 4),
    candidate = add_level(N = 2, U = runif(N))
  ) +
  declare_assignment(assignment_variable = "A1") +
  declare_assignment(assignment_variable = "A2", 
                     conditions = c("young", "middle", "old")) +
  declare_assignment(assignment_variable = "A3")  +
  declare_step(
    E = 
      0.05 * A1 + 
      0.04 * (A2 == "middle") + 
      0.08 * (A2 == "old") + 
      0.02 * A3 + U,
    handler = fabricate) +
  declare_measurement(handler = Y_function) +
  declare_estimator(Y ~ A1 + A2 + A3,
                    model = lm_robust, term = TRUE)
```

### DAG

```{r, echo = FALSE}
dag <- dagify(Y ~ E,
              E ~ U + A1 + A2 + A3)

nodes <-
  tibble(
    name = c("A1", "A2", "A3", "E", "Y", "U"),
    label = c("A1", "A2", "A3", "E", "Y", "U"),
    annotation = c("**Random assignment**<br>Coethnicity attribute",
                   "**Random assignment**<br>Age attribute",
                   "**Random assignment**<br>Gender attribute",
                   "**Latent outcome**<br>Candidate evaluation",
                   "**Measured outcome**<br>Candidate choice",
                   "**Unknown heterogeneity**"),
    x = c(1, 1, 1, 3.5, 5, 3.5),
    y = c(4, 2.5, 1, 2.5, 2.5, 4),
    nudge_direction = c("N", "N", "N", "S", "N", "N"),
    answer_strategy = "uncontrolled"
  )

ggdd_df <- make_dag_df(dag, nodes, design)

base_dag_plot %+% ggdd_df
```
