## Synthesis

<!-- make sure to rename the section title below -->

```{r synthesis, echo = FALSE, output = FALSE, purl = FALSE}
# run the diagnosis (set to TRUE) on your computer for this section only before pushing to Github. no diagnosis will ever take place on github.
do_diagnosis <- FALSE
sims <- 100
b_sims <- 20
```

```{r, echo = FALSE}
# load packages for this section here. note many (DD, tidyverse) are already available, see scripts/package-list.R
```

A research synthesis is a "meta MIDA"

M: A master Model that subsumes portions of the sub Ms?
I: This is a summary of all of the Is across the stueis.
D: This is the inclusion / exclusion criteria. Transformations of the study data. standardization. (sampling, measurement.)
A: things like Random effects, fixed effects, Quimpo.
