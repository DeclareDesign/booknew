Implementation starts from the design declaration. Implementing the data strategy means sampling the units as planned, allocating treatments according to the randomization procedure, and executing the measurement protocol. Implementing the answer strategy means applying the planned summary functions to the realized data. Of course, implementation is much easier said than done. Inevitably, some portion of the design fails to go according to plan: subjects do not comply with treatments, others cannot be located to answer survey questions, or governments interfere with the study as a whole. Sometimes, the answer strategies are discovered to be biased or imprecise or otherwise wanting.
