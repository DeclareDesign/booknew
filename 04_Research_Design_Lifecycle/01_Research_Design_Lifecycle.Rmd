Empirical results tell us what we should believe after conducting a study. Whether we should believe the results or not depends on the quality of the research design. We have highlighted the role of diagnosis in justifying a design but the broader framework we describe has implications for many stages of the research design lifecycle, from design development, to implementation, to the writing and publishing of the piece, and beyond, to the integration of the acquired knowledge into our collective scientific understanding of the world. At each stage of this process, your research design -- your specification of **M**, **I**, **D**, and **A** -- shapes your own choices as well as how others will learn from your work.

This part of the book works through the discrete stages of the lifecycle. While it is presented in a linear fashion, the stages are all intertwined by their common connection to MIDA. For example, we show how many disputes among scholars about the proper interpretation come down to differing understandings of some part of **M**, **I**, **D**, or **A**. If your preanalysis plan is sufficiently precise about your beliefs about these features of your design, then the disputes can be specified more precisely, the better to resolve them. But we also explore how to reason about disputes when there is no preanalysis plan.

Not every research project will explicitly feature all of these stages. For example, prospective research designs like experiments and surveys often included pilot studies to learn about important unknown features of **M** before implementing the full studies. Retrospective studies, like textual analyses of speeches delivered to parliament, might not.
