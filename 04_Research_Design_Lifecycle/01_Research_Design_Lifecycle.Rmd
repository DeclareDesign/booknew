A research design begins with a spark of inspiration or opportunity, develops through a planning phase, comes to fruition through the stages of realization, and adds to knowledge and influences decisions as it is integrated into collective scientific understanding. At each step in the lifecycle, your research design -- your specification of **M**, **I**, **D**, and **A** -- shapes your own choices and how others will learn from your work.

This part of the book works through these stages of the lifecycle. While it is presented linearly, the steps are all intertwined by their shared connection to the research design. For example, we show how many disputes among scholars about the proper interpretation come down to differing understandings of some part of **M**, **I**, **D**, or **A**. If your preanalysis plan is sufficiently precise about your beliefs about these features of your design, then the disputes can be specified more precisely, the better to resolve them. But we also explore how to reason about disputes when there is no preanalysis plan. Not every research project will feature each and every stage. For example, prospective research designs like experiments and surveys often included pilot studies to learn about important unknown features of **M** before implementing the full studies. Retrospective studies, like textual analyses of speeches delivered to parliament, might not. 

We divide the research design life cycle into four broad categories: brainstorming, planning, realization, and integration. Brainstorming is the process of going from the kernel of a research idea to a tractable design declaration. Planning includes all of the activities you undertake before data collection starts -- conducting ethical reviews, obtaining approvals, gathering criticism, organizing partnerships, securing funding, and filing analysis plans. Realization begins with the execution of the data strategy as planned -- and continues through the inevitable changes that come with analytical challenges and scientific surprises. We trace realization through writing, reconciling planned and implemented designs, and responding to peer reviewers. In the final phase of a research project, the results are integrated into the scientific literature. The study informs theories and decisions and is later reanalyzed, replicated, disputed, and meta-analyzed.
