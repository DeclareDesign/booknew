Empirical results are what we think we now know as a result of conducting a study; research design is why we think we know it. The set of reasons why a study means what we think it means -- the research design itself -- is of central importance throughout the entirety of the research design lifecycle, beginning with the research idea in its most embryonic form as a flash of inspiration, through the many phases of implementation, to the actual writing and publishing of the piece, and beyond, to the integration of the acquired knowledge into our collective scientific understanding of the world. At each stage of this process, your research design -- your specification of $M$, $I$, $D$, and $A$ -- shapes your own choices as well as how others will learn from your work.

This part of the book works through each of the many discrete stages of the lifecycle. While it is necessarily presented in a linear fashion, the stages are all deeply entwined by their common connection to MIDA. For example, we show how many disputes among scholars about the proper interpretation come down to differing understandings of some part of M, I, D, or A -- if your preanalysis plan is sufficiently precise about your beliefs about these features of your design, then the disputes can be specified more precisely, the better to resolve them. 

Not every research project will explicitly feature all of these stages. For example, prosepctive research designs like experiments and surveys often included pilot studies to learn about important unknown features of $M$ before implementing the full studies. Retrospective studies, like textual analyses of speeches delivered to Parliament, might not.
