When writing up an empirical paper, the authors must convince reviewers and readers that the question is important in some sense and that the research design they selected provides useful answers to the question. This is where MIDA comes in. Elements of MIDA will appear in every section of a paper, and every element of MIDA should be described somewhere in the paper. Details can be relegated to an appendix, but sufficient information to judge the totality of the design should be included.

A common model for social science empirical papers has five sections: an introduction, theory and hypotheses, research design, results, and discussion. We outline how elements of MIDA can usefully fit into each section here, before providing an exemplar highlighting where each element was described. 

The introduction section should have a capitulation of each aspect of MIDA in brief. The reader is brought quickly up to speed on the whole research design.

The next section, theory and hypotheses, contains information about the causal model of the world ($M$) and the research question about the world ($I$) as well as guesses about $a^M$ (i.e., hypotheses!). The section should lay out all of the features of the model necessary to describe $I$. 

To motivate hypotheses, the theory section can outline our prior beliefs about $a^W$, the true answer to the inquiry, based on past literature. A meta-analysis or systematic review of past evidence could provide a systematic summary of past answers to $a^W$, or an informal literature review could be offered. These priors are used along with the study results to construct posterior beliefs reported in the discussion section, i.e., what we know after conducting the study. In summarizing the literature, it is important to consider the research designs of past studies. Meta-analyses often formally account for the quality of the research designs of past studies by weighting by the inverse of their precision (upweighting informative studies and downweighting uninformative ones). Literature reviews may do so informally. Moreover, the summary of past literature is itself a research design, and so we should try to prevent common research design issues such as selection on the dependent variable by ensuring we discuss all literature and not only present views consonant with our hypotheses.

The research design or methods section should have a description of $D$ and $A$ and a description of a diagnosis of the design. In this section, we defend our choice of $D$ and $A$ under $M$ and $I$. Papers commonly have more than one $D$ and associated $A$ answering the same or related questions; both $D$ and $A$ for each should be described in this section. 

The results section can be brief, simply describing $a^D$. Increasingly, results are presented visually as well as in text, in order to effectively communicate the results to the reader. As we discuss in Section XX, visualizing the modeled results as well as the raw data can both improve how the results are communicated and simultaneously help readers connect the research design, the data, and the results.

The discussion section is a chance to tell the reader what has been learned about $a^M$ and more broadly about $M$ from $a^D$ given the design. The discussion section is also a chance to point to new MIDAs that could be implemented to learn more about $M$.

9. Discussion section stuff. This is where we form "posteriors". That is, we interpret $a^M$ in light of beliefs about $M$. We also *update* about $M$. for example, you might learn that an edge you (or someone) thought existed doesn't exist. Heterogeneity teaches you about "functional form". You might posit the existence of unmeasured but nevertheless real nodes.
<!-- 10. This might be the place where you propose new MIDAs that help you to learn about your updated M. -->

7. Elaborations of the basic structure. Sometimes multi-paper. They should at a minimum have the same M. Sometimes a paper is multiple ways of getting at the same I.  sometimes it's different Is. This is where we talk about the psych 3 paper diesgn:  study 1, correlation between X and Y. Study 2 is randomize X.  Study 3 is pretend to learn mechanisms by which X affects Y.

![Paper with MIDA elements highlighted (Mousa 2020)](figures/mousa-highlighted-sheet.pdf)

In Figure XX, we illustrate where elements of MIDA are incorporated into a paper, using the example of @mousa2020building. We highlight areas discussing the model $M$ in yellow, the inquiry $I$ in green, the data strategy $D$ in blue, and the answer strategy $A$ in pink. The model and the inquiry largely appear in the abstract and introductory portion of the paper, though aspects of the model are discussed later on. Much of the first three pages are devoted to the data strategy, while the answer strategy only appears briefly. This division makes sense: in this paper, the action is all in the experimental design whereas the answer strategy follows straightforwardly from it using the principles of analyze as you randomize. The paper mostly describes $M$ and $D$, with only a small portion devoted to $I$ and $A$. Finally, it is notable that the data strategy is interspersed with aspects of the model. The reason is that the author is justifying choices about randomization and measurement using features of the model. This highlights the deep connection between the two discussed in Part II. 

<!-- Big ideas: -->
<!-- - make sure to have all of MIDA in your paper! -->
<!-- - please keep kosher.  Theory section material belongs in the theory section, not in the design or results section, etc. -->
