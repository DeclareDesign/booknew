## Writing

<!-- make sure to rename the section title below -->

```{r writing, echo = FALSE, output = FALSE, purl = FALSE}
# run the diagnosis (set to TRUE) on your computer for this section only before pushing to Github. no diagnosis will ever take place on github.
do_diagnosis <- FALSE
sims <- 100
b_sims <- 20
```

```{r, echo = FALSE}
# load packages for this section here. note many (DD, tidyverse) are already available, see scripts/package-list.R
```

### Writing a paper

basic outline of an empirical paper is: intro, theory, design, results, discussion.

- Introduction: Mini MIDA
- Theory: M, I, guesses about $a^M$
- Design: D, A; diagnosis under M and I. 
- Results: $a^D$
- Discussion: what we learn about $a^M$ and $M$ from $a^D$

Comments:
1. please keep kosher.  Theory section material belongs in the theory section, not in the design or results section, etc.

2. in discussion sections, often researchers talk about about future research. That's because some inquiries are not addressed by the current MIDA, so in light of $a^D$, new MIDAs can be proposed.

3. Theory sections are for a couple of things. first they are about $M$ (what are the relevant features of the model necessary to describe $I$). Second, they summarise what the  previous literature has to say about $I$. In particular what we think $a^M$ might be. often this is just a sign.

4. The literature review section should be aware of the MIDAs that were used to generate past $a^D$s.  If they are poor (e.g., prone to bias), they should get less weight. Also should not selectively review in the sense that contrary views should also included, conditional on good MIDAs.

5. A literature review is a "summary function" in the sense that it is a qualitative meta-analysis. That summary function should be purged of researcher bias (of course hard to know for sure)

6. Little something here on "primacy claims"

7. Elaborations of the basic structure. Sometimes multi-paper. They should at a minimum have the same M. Sometimes a paper is multiple ways of getting at the same I.  sometimes it's different Is. This is where we talk about the psych 3 paper diesgn:  study 1, correlation between X and Y. Study 2 is randomize X.  Study 3 is pretend to learn mechanisms by which X affects Y.

8. something here about "mixing methods"  If they all have different Is, then you can't make up for the deficiencies of one method with the strengths of the others. If they have the same Is, then perhaps we "triangulate" ?

9. Discussion section stuff. This is where we form "posteriors". That is, we interpret $a^M$ in light of beliefs about $M$. We also *update* about $M$. for example, you might learn that an edge you (or someone) thought existed doesn't exist. Heterogeneity teaches you about "functional form". You might posit the existence of unmeasured but nevertheless real nodes.

10. This might be the place where you propose new MIDAs that help you to learn about your updated M.
