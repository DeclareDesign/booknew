Ethical review by institutional review boards (IRBs) is required in many countries, and in some additional review is required by entities governing health and other specific types of research. Social scientists are also increasingly focused on meeting ethical standards that go beyond the requirements of these national laws. Ethical appendices are required by some journals describing protections for human subjects and many funding agencies now require defenses of the ethics of a research study before funds are disbursed.

Common ethical principles include respect for persons, benificence (researchers must have the welfare of participants in mind in designing the research), informed consent by participants, and minimizing harm to participants and others. Several parts of a research design are implicated in these principles: the data strategy, which affects who is selected to participate (thus who is affected directly and also indirectly by the research), what treatments are given to them and to whom, and what measures are collected from them; the answer strategy, which determines what information about participants is shared with the broader public; and even the inquiry, which affects the value of the research to participants and society.

We discussed in the data strategy section how different data strategies may be more or less ethically encumbered. A common concern is that measurement imposes an ethical cost on subjects by wasting their time. Subjects' time is a valuable resource -- they often donate willingly to the scientific enterprise by taking a survey or similar. Sometimes their generosity is repaid with financial compensation for their time. Sometimes subjects are unknowing participants in a research study because obtaining informed consent would so distort their behavior as to hinder the ability of the researchers to study it.

The intimate connections between a study's the research design and ethical outcomes implies that not only do choices about MIDA affect the ethical status of the project, different realizations of the data will result in different effects on the researcher's perceived respect for persons, the level of informed consent, and harm caused by the study. As a result, the ethics of the study cannot only be determined by looking at what happened during the study --- how many participants were there and how many were treated, how many were harmed, and how many raised complaints. Instead, the ethical status of the project depends on judgments about *potential* harms and *potential* participants: not only what did happen, but what could have happened. 

We discussed in the diagnosis section how expected ethical downsides can be formalized as diagnosands so that researchers can choose the best design among the studies they judge to be ethical across possible realizations; or if designs can't be discretized into ethical and non ethical, researchers can explicitly consider how much cost they are willing to impose on subjects to learn about the world.

Every researcher should consider the ethical implications of the data and answer strategies for research staff and participants. Some research projects should not be conducted.

Scholars are increasingly calling for reporting of ethical considerations in study design beyond IRB approval. By declaring your expectations about the ethical outcomes of an experiment in terms of diagnosands such as the time participants devote to the study and the probability of harm to individuals, a declared research design can be an input to ethical reporting. Readers can review how you considered ethical outcomes in your design and judge the mitigation efforts you undertook in relation to those expectations.
