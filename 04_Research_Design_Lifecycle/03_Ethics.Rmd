## Ethical Review

<!-- make sure to rename the section title below -->

```{r ethical_review, echo = FALSE, output = FALSE, purl = FALSE}

# load packages for this section here. note many (DD, tidyverse) are already available, see scripts/package-list.R

As members of society, we are all enjoined to act ethically in all areas of our lives, and the specific domain of conducting research is no different in this respect. Laws specifically govern many areas of research activity -- we don't have much to say about these legal questions except that researchers should obey the local laws. 

Similarly, we don't have much to say about the governing role of institutional review boards (or IRBs). IRBs apply rules to research activity; the application of these rules is quite varied from institution to institution, and this variation can appear quite arbitrary to the individual researcher seeking IRB approval. Obtaining IRB approval is an absolute necessity for most empirical projects (even when the approval is nothing more than an affirmation that the research project is exempt from IRB oversight!). That said, the approbation of the IRB has very little to do with the ethical status of a research projects. Many unethical studies could pass IRB review and many ethical studies can run into frustrating IRB headaches. For a fascinating history of how we came to have the modern IRB, we recommend "Ethical Imperialism," which describes how procedures that were originally designed for medical trials were applied, mostly without modification, to social scientific research studies.

Instead, we concieve of the effect of research activities on the well-being of research staff, participants, and perhaps even future consumers of the research product as additional Inquiries that researchers have an ethical obligation to learn about. 

We discussed in the data strategy section (section ZZZ) how different data strategies may be more or less ethically encumbered. A common concern is that measurement imposes an ethical cost on subjects by wasting their time. Subjects' time is a valuable resource -- they often donate willingly to the scientific enterprise by taking a survey or similar. Sometimes their generosity is repaid with finanical compensation for their time. Sometimes subjects are unknowing participants in a research study because obtaining informed consent would so distort their behavior as to hinder the ability of the researchers to study it.

We discussed in the diagnosis section how expected ethical downsides can be formalized as diagnosands so that researchers can choose the best design among the "ethical" studies; or if designs can't be discretized into ethical and non ethical, researchers can explicitly consider how much cost they are willing to impose on subjects to learn truths.

Every researcher should consider the ethical implications of the data and answer strategies for research staff and participants. Some research projects should not be conducted -- the vast majority of those projects are typically weeded out well before the ethical review stage.

It's important to communicate your design choices so that they can specifically evaluate your ethical judgements. It's difficult for others to understand (a) your design and (b) what the ethical tradeoffs truly entail. Declared designs help immensely because they focus attention on what part, exactly, people are responding to.

- Is it the measurement they object to? Is it the random assignment?
