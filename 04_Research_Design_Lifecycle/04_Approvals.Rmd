When researchers sit at universities in the U.S., research must be approved by the university's institutional review board (IRB) under the federal regulation known as the "Common Rule." Similar research review bodies exist at universities around the world and at many independent research organizations and think tanks. Though these boards are commonly thought to judge the ethics of a piece of research, in fact they exist to protect their institution from liability for research gone awry (King and Sands 2015). This means that a researcher's obligation to consider the ethics of their study is neither constrained nor checked by IRBs. Instead, a set of idiosyncratic rules and practices specific to the institution are checked. The researcher, as a result, remains responsible for their own ethical decision about whether or not to move forward with the research. The IRB process is not necessarily without benefit: in some cases, useful discussions can be had with IRB board members about study decisions. The approval itself may protect the researcher from some kinds of liability. 

Laws and regulations at the country, state or province, and municipality level may also govern research on human subjects besides the IRB. Many countries require human subjects approval for research, especially for health research, in addition to the approvals researchers must seek from their home institutions. These approvals serve a similar purpose to the home institution IRB, but by virtue of their authority coming from the context in which the research is conducted rather than from far away bureaucrats. 

Though the goals of these bodies differ from the broader ethical aims social scientists hold, design diagnosis may also be useful here. Many IRBs ask researchers to describe tradeoffs between the costs and benefits to research subjects. In some cases, researchers are asked to defend research design choices that provide benefits to science, but the only direct effects on participants are costs (e.g., the time to participate) without direct benefits. Defining the costs and benefits to participants in terms of their time and money as well as the compensation provide by researchers, if any, can both simplify communication with IRBs and provide tools for researchers to more easily clarify these tradeoffs for themselves. The expected benefit and expected cost can be diagnosands across possible realizations of the design. The design diagnosis can highlight tradeoffs, then, between the value to participants and the scientific value in the form of standard diagnosands such as root mean-squared error or more ambitiously the likelihood of shifting priors about the research question. Rather than argue in the abstract about these quantities, they can be simulated and described formally through declaration and diagnosis.
