# Planning

We obtain an initial design by brainstorming, and then set about the process of planning the study. The end goal is a full plan for the data strategy and answer strategy that, optionally, may be preregistered in a preanalysis plan. Whether or not we file a PAP, the process of declaring, diagnosing, and redesigning the study can lead to an improved design. Declaring studies improves studies. The process can also more easily yield a design that meets ethical as well as scientific standards, accommodates the needs of research partners, and works within financial and logistical constraints. When we are insufficiently sure of key inputs to design declarations, we can run pilots, but we need to be careful about how we incorporate what we learn from them. Finally, when we write up a declaration or a PAP with a declaration, this can be a useful moment to get feedback from our peers to improve the design. We discuss each of these steps in this chapter.
