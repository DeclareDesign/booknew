## Writing a Preanalysis Plan

<!-- make sure to rename the section title below -->

```{r writing_pap, echo = FALSE, output = FALSE, purl = FALSE}
# run the diagnosis (set to TRUE) on your computer for this section only before pushing to Github. no diagnosis will ever take place on github.
do_diagnosis <- FALSE
sims <- 100
b_sims <- 20
```

```{r, echo = FALSE}
# load packages for this section here. note many (DD, tidyverse) are already available, see scripts/package-list.R
```


- The design declaration itself is a compact description of the study you want to conduct
- The diagnosis (and redesign process) shows why you picked the design you did.
- the Mock analysis section should run the actual tables and figures you plan to create using a draw of the design.
