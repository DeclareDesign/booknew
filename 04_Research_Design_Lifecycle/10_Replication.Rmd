## Replication

<!-- make sure to rename the section title below -->

```{r replication, echo = FALSE, output = FALSE, purl = FALSE}
# run the diagnosis (set to TRUE) on your computer for this section only before pushing to Github. no diagnosis will ever take place on github.
do_diagnosis <- FALSE
sims <- 100
b_sims <- 20
```

```{r, echo = FALSE}
# load packages for this section here. note many (DD, tidyverse) are already available, see scripts/package-list.R
```

Replication and reanalysis important for two main reasons: 
- They improve accumulation of knowledge across studies by providing new or improved information (estimates and data) on estimands
- They improve ex-ante incentives of authors

But both pose a hard task: produce answers to the original study that are at least as good or even better than the original answers, possibly using different procedures and usually under different conditions

Moreover: Splashy reanalysis is rewarded, so suspicion of bad faith can arise



### new thoughts

- Hold $I$ constant; $M$ may be slightly different because of contextual differences; not to mention the learning that took place because of the original study. (if effects are likely to be small, we learn that and change the size of the study accordingly (small telescopes?))
