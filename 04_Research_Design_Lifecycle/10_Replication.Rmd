After your study is completed, it may one day be replicated. Replication differs from reanalysis in that a replication study involves the specification of a new MIDA and collection of new data. As discussed in the previous, a reanalysis may re-specify parts of the research design, but always re-uses the original data $d$ in some way. 

So-called "exact" replications hold key features of I, D, and A fixed, but draw a new dataset $d_{new}$ from $D()$ and apply the same $A$ to the new $d$ in order to produce a fresh answer $a_{new}^D$. Replications are said to "succeed" when $a_{old}^D$ and $a_{new}^D$ are similar and to "fail" when they are not. Dichotomizing replication attempts into successes and failures is usually not that helpful, and it would be better to simply characterize how similar $a_{old}^D$ and $a_{new}^D$ are.

Replication studies benefit enormously from the knowledge gains produced by the original studies. For example, we learn a large amount about $M$ and the likely value of $a^M$ from the original study. The $M$ of the replication study can and should incorportate this new information. For example, if we learn from the original study that $a^M$ is positive but it might be small, the replication study could respond by changing $D$ in order to increase the sample size. This is the intuition behind the "small telescopes" paper, which offers a rule of thumb for how much larger replication studies should be than original studies. We think this rule of thumb is useful, though design diagnosis and redesign is an even better way to learn about how to change the design of the replication study in light of the original study.

When designing **original** studies, you should anticipate that someday your work will be replicated. This improves your *ex ante* incentives. To the extent that you want future replication studies to arrive a similar answers to the original study you produce (i.e., you want their $a_{new}^D$ to match your $a_{old}^D$ as closely as possible), you will want to choose designs that bring $a_{old}^D$ as close to $a^M$ as possible, under the presupposition that faithful replicators will also design their studies in such a way that $a_{new}^D$ will also be close to $a^M$.

Replication studies necessarily differ from original studies -- it is literally impossible to reproduce the exact conditions of the original study in the same way it's impossible to step in the same river twice. Another way of putting that same statment is that $D_{new}$ is necessarily different from $D_{old}$. Theory (i.e., beliefs about $M$) is the tool we use to say that $D_{old}$ is similar enough to $D_{new}$ to consititute a close enough replication study. As a concrete example, many survey experimental replications involve using the exact same experimental stimuli but changing the study sample, e.g., from a nationally representative sample to a convenience sample.

So-called "conceptual" replications alter both $M$ and $D$, but keep $I$ and $A$ as similar as possible. That is, a conceptual replication tries to ascertain whether a relationship in one context ($I(M_{old})$) also holds in a new context ($I(M_{new}$). The trouble and promise of conceptual replications lies in the success of the designer at holding $I$ constant. Too often, a conceptual replication fails because in changing $M$, too much changes about $I$ such that too much changes about the "concept" under replication.
