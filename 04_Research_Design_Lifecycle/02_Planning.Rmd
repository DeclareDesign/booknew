- provide your MIDA

Pre-analysis plans (PAPs) are used by researchers to register a set of analyses before they learn about outcomes. PAPs clarify which choices were made before observing outcomes and which were made afterwards. Ironically, the set of decisions that should be specified in a PAP is itself remarkably unclear. PAP templates and checklists are proliferating, and the number of items they suggest range from nine to sixty. PAPs themselves are becoming longer and more detailed, with some in the American Economic Association (AEA) and Evidence in Governance and Politics (EGAP) study registries reaching hundreds of pages, as researchers seek to be ever more comprehensive. For all that, it is hard to assess whether these detailed plans actually contain key analytically-relevant details.

Lot of debate about the value of PAPs (cite cite cite). Summary. Our take: these are helpful tools for researchers to plan research better; and they have a single interpretation that is useful, clarifying what the researcher was thinking at each stage. Their information signal is a function of the distance from the start of post-intervention outcome data collection. But they are useful at any stage to clarify what decisions were made when.

MIDA provides a roadmap: a PAP centered around MIDA will describe the researcher's beliefs about the world, research questions, interventions and measurement, and analysis plans informed by these other elements. The PAP can include a research design diagnosis to communicate the properties of the design as understood before seeing the results of the study, highlighting the diagnosands the researcher believed were important.

-- involving partners
-- exante vs expost power calculations
-- frontloading research design decisions (get more specific, identify problems)
-- what happens when things go wrong (not just ideal plan, but plan for how you deal with problems; SOPs) -- attrition, noncompliance, study failure, missing covariate data, etc. -- the properties of your design depend not only on the ideal plan but the procedure
-- registered reports: part of your answer strategy is how you present and writup results. registered reports are a version of preanalysis plans that include the full results-free writeup. virtue is you prespecify the whole answer strategy! you can do if-then guides to writing up.
-- shouldn't just be about analysis. prespecify what you will do in D during implementation if things go wrong, this informs what we can learn. if you drop some units before random assignment (or after), will you rerandomize, add units, change sampling, etc.? this informs what we learn about the design (often expanding what we can learn by saying - if we try to treat this type of unit we won't be able to)


Benefits
-- Declaration can reduce ambiguities in the design. For example, a PAP that says the researchers will “use OLS with clustered standard errors” leaves out which covariates will be included and how they will be coded, whether any interactions will be estimated, and which of several common formulae will be used to calculate standard errors. By contrast, an answer strategy declared in code makes each of these choices explicit.
-- Design declaration can minimize the risk of fishing critiques, since the number of small decisions about modeling and constructing tables and figures that take place after data collection is substantially reduced given the ability to simulate data beforehand.
-- Design declaration may minimize the need for deviations. Simulating the design may reveal aspects of the design researchers were unaware of — variables they did not (yet) plan to collect, assumptions they did not know they needed to make, or planned design strategies were infeasible. The improvements come before implementation not afterwards.
-- Fairer replication, fairer reanalysis. Replicators lose a degree of freedom in determining what an author might have intended by a given analysis. Moreover, ex ante design diagnosis communicates the assumptions under which they thought the design was a good one before they ran the study. This makes it clearer whether a re-analysis involves an improvement in estimation strategies given a researcher’s assumptions or instead requires deviations from a researcher’s assumptions in order to to be justified.
-- Easier design comparison. If a design is declared at the preanalysis plan phase, then it enables direct comparison with the design as implemented in the final write-up. Side-by-side comparison of the code neatly clarifies which design choices were made ex-ante and ex-post. Side-by-side comparison of the performance of a planned and implemented designs clarify under what conditions deviations from plans are defensible improvements.




















- The design declaration itself is a compact description of the study you want to conduct
- The diagnosis (and redesign process) shows why you picked the design you did.
- the Mock analysis section should run the actual tables and figures you plan to create using a draw of the design.
- ethics (summarize and cite Jay's ideas here: http://www.jasonlyall.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/PreregisterYourEthics.pdf)
- ethical outcomes are potential outcomes, so we need to think about them ex ante not just on the basis of revealed outcomes


- SOPs
