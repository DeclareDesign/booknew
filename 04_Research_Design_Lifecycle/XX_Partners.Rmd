Partnering with organizations for intervening in the world and for measurement is becoming increasingly common in the social sciences. Organizations can learn about how to achieve their (private) goals better by partnering with social scientists to study current programs and policies in order to improve them. Social scientists' private goals are to learn about how to achieve public goals -- generalizations of the private goals of partner organizations. Social scientists' goals may simply be to contribute to knowledge about how the world works or they may be to learn about how to achieve public goals such as improving voter turnout. Understanding the private goals of the partner and the private goals of the researcher is essential to selecting a joint research design that will be amenable to both parties. MIDA can help in doing this, by formalizing tradeoffs between the two sets of goals.

One common divergence between these sets of goals is that partner organizations often do want to learn, but their primary mission is focused on doing. Learning how to do better (how to achieve their goals better) is a goal, but it may be at least in the short term secondary to trying to do achieve the goal. This may be because contributors or other constituents expect to see *outputs* rather than *outcomes*, often understandably because it is simpler to monitor the outputs of an organization (trainings held, doors knocked on) than *outcomes* (quality services provided, votes changed). Because of this at least short-term divergence in goals, a central tradeoff in partnering with organizations is a learning-doing tradeoff. Both researchers and organizations wish to "do" (produce outputs) and "learn" (learn how to better translate outputs into outcomes), but because of the difference in goals the weight they place on these two activities may differ. 

Research design diagnosis can help navigate the learning-doing tradeoff. One instance of the tradeoff is that the proportion of units who receive a treatment (e.g., a medicine) represents the rate of "doing" and also affects the amount of learning in that in the extreme if all units are treated there can (typically) be no learning about the *effect* of the treatment. The tradeoff here is represented in a graph of the RMSE vs. the proportion treated. In the absence of partners, researchers might simply ignore the proportion treated axis and select the proportion with the lowest RMSE. With a partner organization, the researcher might use this graph in conversation with the partner to jointly select the design that has the lowest RMSE that has a sufficiently high proportion treated to meet the partner's needs to satisfy its stakeholders.

-- MIDA can also help clarify how constraints faced by the partner affect the quality of the research, to help make decisions about whether to relax that constraint (or continue with the research)
