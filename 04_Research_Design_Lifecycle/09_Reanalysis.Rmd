## Reanalysis

<!-- make sure to rename the section title below -->

```{r reanalysis, echo = FALSE, output = FALSE, purl = FALSE}
# run the diagnosis (set to TRUE) on your computer for this section only before pushing to Github. no diagnosis will ever take place on github.
do_diagnosis <- FALSE
sims <- 100
b_sims <- 20
```

```{r, echo = FALSE}
# load packages for this section here. note many (DD, tidyverse) are already available, see scripts/package-list.R
```



The crucial thing about a reanalysis is that $d$ is fixed. You can bring new $M$'s $I$'s and $A$s to bear, but the revealed data is fixed.




how do we update from the reanalysis research design (the original design plus the reanalysis of d)?
-- the design is the research design from before with two sets of estimates from two different A's
-- need an aggregation function (decisionmaking function) that converts the two sets of results into a decision or posterior

A is constrained: it must follow from the D of the study, which cannot be changed because the study was run already.

what can be learned from reanalysis?
(1) confirm there were not errors (consider changing A only)
(2) reassess what is known about the same inquiry, using new information about the world (change M, change A to suit new M)
(3) learn something new from the data about another node or edge or a different summary about the same ones (change I and possibly A to match it; possibly M if a node was missing; possibly add data)
(4) assess "robustness" of findings - point to discussion of this in answer strategy (or move it here) (change A)
(5) update M based on new research and assess what d can tell us from this study (change M and possibly I, possibly A to fit changed M and I)

how can we assess the properties of a *reanalysis*? diagnose changed MIDA. important to not condition on d, the design includes the actual D, and we need to consider what results d' we would get from the reanalysis under different realizations of D.

there are now two A's, so need to specify a decision function about how to integrate the two findings. this could be throw away the old a, or combine them in some way. if it's a "robustness" to alternative A, then you may want to combine not throw out for example. it's crucial to specify how you do that, that's part of the answer strategy.
