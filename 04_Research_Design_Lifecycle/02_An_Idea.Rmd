A research design starts from an idea, a kernel of a project. People arrive at their good ideas from every direction through idiosyncratic processes. Some people are inspired by their reading of academic literature. Others are sparked by a conversation with colleagues. Still others have their research questions thrust upon them by exigent circumstances. Ideas come from primary observation of social processes, reading secondary accounts by other authors, and our own past thoughts and experiences. 

Whatever the mysterious process is that ignites the imagination, we can characterize what part (or parts) of the research design the idea is about. Ideas can be a piece of a model, a vague inquiry, a part of a data strategy, or an exciting answer strategy. An idea in the form of a model includes one or more nodes and one or more edges between them: for example, a treatment, a mediator, and an outcome. An inquiry is perhaps the most common kernel of a research project. It might be "does D cause Y." A data strategy might be the discovery of a discontinuity in some administrative rule. A research project that starts with an answer strategy might be a new audio analysis technique that enables answering questions about the relationship between the content and emotional tenor of speech.

The goal of brainstorming is to build a complete design from this kernel, regardless of where in the four elements *M*, *I*, *D*, or *A* the idea starts out. A "theory-first" approach might start with *M* or *I* and an "opportunity-first" approach might between with *D* or *A*. 


<!-- - much standard research advice cautions against selecting a data strategy or answer strategy, because it is thought to lead to work that does not meet the goa -->

We think there should be no shame in starting with a data strategy or answer strategy. The ordering is criticized by some for not focusing on "big questions." We think progress in social science can come from many places. We should seek to provide credible answers to important questions, and often progress in providing credible answers will start with new data and answer strategies. We should then judge MIDA in terms of the importance of the question -- in practical or theoretical terms -- and the design's strength to provide answers. 

## Theory-first: Starting with a model or inquiry

We often come to a research project either with an outcome variable we want to explain or with a question about how a specific treatment affects an outcome. In the terminology of causal graphs, we come with a node (variable) or an edge (the relationship between two variables). 

Our first task is to translate this kernel of an idea into a complete inquiry. Do we want to know the node's average value, an approximation of its distribution, or its mode? If the kernel is an edge, do we want to understand whether X causes Y, Y causes X, or whether the effects of X on Y interact with a third variable? Defining the inquiry may expand our kernel of an idea: if we started with Y but decide our inquiry is the effect of X on Y, then now we have an edge for our kernel. 

The second step is to build out a more complete model around our kernel. The model should include both the node or edge we believe to exist (or want to disprove) and alternative theories and data structures that could explain the kernel. A general algorithm provides guidance for how to build out a *set* of graphical causal models from the kernel, though building out each kernel will be different:

Algorithm for building a causal model from an inquiry
:::

To build a set of possible causal models that you can use to judge your research design against, start with a node or edge that defines the inquiry and then build from there:

1. Add common causes of all nodes. Add unknown causes as a node to reflect all of the unknown common causes.
2. If there are intermediate nodes reflecting mechanisms, add an alternative mechanism. 
3. Construct graphs representing all combinations of edges, including lack of edges, between the nodes.
4. Rule out graphs that are cyclic and that are impossible based on substantive knowledge.

::::

The resulting set of causal models are nonparametric. In order to encode beliefs about how variables relate to each other or how treatment effects may differ, you may wish to add parametric structure to your set of models. Together, the set models define the model *M* of *MIDA*. With a model and inquiry in hand, we can go in search of a data and answer strategy that together can provide an answer to the inquiry. 

## Opportunity-first: Starting with a data or answer strategy

[This section to be rewritten]

Research ideas often begin with some snippet of a data strategy: a treatment we can feasibly implement or an opportunity to sample participants from a difficult-to-study population. 

We can also start the research process with a new answer strategy. Our idea might be a new statistical model or a new way of cleaning and analyzing data from video or audio.

We first need to identify an inquiry that might be answered with the new answer strategy. There might be many, but the first step is picking one or a feasibly small number of them. We can then build a model from that inquiry using the algorithm described above. 



<!-- We need to reverse the process we used to start with a node or edge: here, we need to find the node or edge to study with our treatment, instrument, sampling procedure, or measurement strategy. If we can measure Y, we want to think about what X's might explain variation in Y, or we might just describe its variation. If we can implement treatment Z, we want to think of all the outcomes it might affect. With an instrument, we want to know what endogenous treatments it affects and which outcomes those affect. With a new sampling strategy, we want to know what variables we could measure and causal relationships we could study among the population we can now sample. Now, we use the algorithm for building a model from the inquiry to construct our model. The last step is to identify an answer strategy that can provide a useful answer to the inquiry, given the data produced by the data strategy you started with. Often the answer strategy follows from the data strategy. If we started with an instrument, we would use instrumental variables if the inquiry is the local effect. If the inquiry is the first stage effect or the reduced form effect, we will instead use linear regression or difference-in-means. If we started with a treatment and a way to randomize it, our answer strategy would follow our randomization procedure. We would analyze the data at the level of treatment assignment among randomized units, and account for varying probabilities of assignment. More generally, the design library in Part III can provide general ideas for answer strategies linked to many common data strategies. The answer strategy chapter of Part III provides specific guidance on ensuring the analysis matches the data strategy. -->



<!-- So you have a new modeling strategy -->



## Brainstorming sessions 

Brainstorming sessions can help take a kernel of an idea and identify a set of possible research designs building on it. These candidate designs can then be diagnosed and assessed for feasibility. But what do participants in the brainstorming session need to know about your idea so they can effectively help identify possible designs? We suggest using the following "problem statement." The core task is to place your kernel of an idea into MIDA.^[The problem statement idea was developed by Graeme Blair, Darin Christensen, Erin Hartman, and Chad Hazlett for a research design seminar at UCLA.] You need not have all the parts of MIDA --- that's why you are having a brainstorming session! But systematizing what you do know is helpful. The more information you can provide, even if it is the range of possibilities rather than an exact specification of the context or the model, the more informative the session can be.

<!-- - if cannot specify any of M, I, or D, it will usually be hard to help. a common situation is having a context or a topic of interest. this is fine! but this may not be enough to yield a productive brainstorming session about designs, because the other participants will not know what part *you* are interested in. we can all imagine many theoretical ideas, research questions, and research strategies that would be of interest to ourselves, but until you specify a theoretical kernel, an inquiry, or a data strategy we can't fill in the rest of the blanks for you. -->
