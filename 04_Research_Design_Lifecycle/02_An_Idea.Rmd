# Before

## Idea

<!-- make sure to rename the section title below -->

```{r idea, echo = FALSE, output = FALSE, purl = FALSE}
# run the diagnosis (set to TRUE) on your computer for this section only before pushing to Github. no diagnosis will ever take place on github.
do_diagnosis <- FALSE
sims <- 100
b_sims <- 20
```

```{r, echo = FALSE}
# load packages for this section here. note many (DD, tidyverse) are already available, see scripts/package-list.R
```

two ways to start:
-- start with a theory and identify inquiries that will rule out alternatives
-- start with an identified result and built up to a theory

Brainstorming sessions can be useful to take a kernel of idea and identify a set of possible research designs building on it. These candidate designs can then be diagnosed and assessed for feasibility. But what do participants in the brainstorming session need to know about your idea so they can effectively help identify possible designs? We suggest using the following "problem statement", where the core task is to place your kernel of an idea into MIDA.^[The problem statement idea was developed by Graeme Blair, Darin Christensen, Erin Hartman, and Chad Hazlett for a research design seminar at UCLA. ] You need not have all the parts of MIDA --- that's why you are having a brainstorming session! But systematizing what you do know is helpful. 

- it's not usually helpful to have just an answer strategy
- if cannot specify any of M, I, or D, it will usually be hard to help. a common situation is having a context or a topic of interest. this is fine! but this may not be enough to yield a productive brainstorming session about designs, because the other participants will not know what part *you* are interested in. we can all imagine many theoretical ideas, research questions, and research strategies that would be of interest to ourselves, but until you specify a theoretical kernel, an inquiry, or a data strategy we can't fill in the rest of the blanks for you.



```{block2, type='FOO'}

**Problem statement**
  
**Model**
  
What is the population of units of interest? How many are there? What are their characteristics?
  
What is your theoretical model?
- Draw a graphical representation of this part of the model (see Chapter 5). What are the variables that matter? Are they causally connected? In which direction? What parts are you confident in based on past work or your observations and what parts do you want to learn about from the design?
  
**Inquiry**
  
What are your research questions?
- If you have a model (above), express your question in terms of the variables in your model. 
- If you started with a model, what are all of the inquiries that are implied by the model, that would provide empirical evidence to support or falsify your theoretical model?
  
Why is this question important? If we learned the answer, what part of the world would we understand better (in other words, what subgraph of a model of the world would we know something new about or be more confident in?). 
  
**Data strategy**

Do you have a treatment assignment scheme in mind? At what level will you randomize? How many units can be assigned to each condition? 

Do you have a measurement scheme in mind? What variables will you measure? With what instrument? 

What is the ideal experiment you would run, if there were no constraints? (This exercise may help to stimulate ideas both about experiments you could feasibly run and what observational designs might mimic this ideal experiment.)
  
**Answer strategy**

How will you use the data that results from your proposed data strategy to produce answers to your inquiry?
