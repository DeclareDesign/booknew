A research design starts from an idea, a kernel of a project. People arrive at their good ideas from every direction using their idiosyncratic processes. Some people are inspired by their reading of the academic literature, others are sparked by a conversation with colleagues, still others have their research questions thrust upon them by exigent circumstance. Ideas come from primary observation of social processes; reading secondary accounts by other authors in books, journal articles, magazines, and newspapers; and from our own past thoughts and experiences. 

Whatever the mysterious process is that ignites the process, we can characterize what part (or parts) of the research design the idea is about. Ideas can be a piece of a model, a vague inquiry, a part of a data strategy, or an exciting answer strategy. An idea in the form of a model includes one or more nodes and one or more edges between them: for example, a treatment, a mediator, and an outcome. An inquiry is perhaps the most common kernel of a research project, and might be "does D cause Y." A data strategy might be the discovery of a discontinuity in some administrative rule. A research project that starts with an answer strategy might be the discovery of a new technique for audio analysis that enables answering questions about the relationship between the content and emotional tenor of speech.

The goal of brainstorming is to build out M, I, D, A into a complete design, regardless of where in the four elements the idea starts out. 

### Starting with a model

A model can start with just one node (outcome variable) or one edge (causal relationship between another node and that outcome node) of primary interest. With this kernel in hand, we can expand the model in several steps.

1. If there are intermediate nodes reflecting mechanisms, add an alternative mechanism. 

2. Add common causes of all nodes. Add unknown causes as a node to reflect all of the unknown common causes.

3. Construct graphs representing all combinations of edges, including lack of edges, between the nodes.

4. Rule out graphs that are cyclic and that are impossible based on substantive knowledge.

5. Add a node for each outcome representing the observed outcome, to reflect possible measurement error.

6. Add nodes you control: sampling (if in the data strategy), treatment assignment (if in the data strategy), 

-- common causes

### Starting with an inquiry

<!-- - build your model from the kernel defined by the inquiry, then choose a data and answer strategy that target the inquiry "well" -->

## Starting with a data strategy

So you have a treatment you can implement

So you have a new measurement strategy

## Starting with an answer strategy 

So you have an instrument and you want to use IV

So you have a new modeling strategy

- much standard research advice cautions against selecting a data strategy or answer strategy, because it is thought to lead to work that does not meet the goa


Brainstorming sessions can be useful to take a kernel of idea and identify a set of possible research designs building on it. These candidate designs can then be diagnosed and assessed for feasibility. But what do participants in the brainstorming session need to know about your idea so they can effectively help identify possible designs? We suggest using the following "problem statement", where the core task is to place your kernel of an idea into MIDA.^[The problem statement idea was developed by Graeme Blair, Darin Christensen, Erin Hartman, and Chad Hazlett for a research design seminar at UCLA. ] You need not have all the parts of MIDA --- that's why you are having a brainstorming session! But systematizing what you do know is helpful. 

- it's not usually helpful to have just an answer strategy
- if cannot specify any of M, I, or D, it will usually be hard to help. a common situation is having a context or a topic of interest. this is fine! but this may not be enough to yield a productive brainstorming session about designs, because the other participants will not know what part *you* are interested in. we can all imagine many theoretical ideas, research questions, and research strategies that would be of interest to ourselves, but until you specify a theoretical kernel, an inquiry, or a data strategy we can't fill in the rest of the blanks for you.

Instructions: fill out any part you can!

**Model**
  
What is the population of units of interest? How many are there? What are their characteristics?
  
What is your theoretical model? Draw a graphical representation of this part of the model. What are the variables that matter? Are they causally connected? In which direction? What parts are you confident in based on past work or your observations and what parts do you want to learn about from the design?
  
**Inquiry**
  
What are your research questions?
- If you have a model (above), express your question in terms of the variables in your model. 
- If you started with a model, what are all of the inquiries that are implied by the model, that would provide empirical evidence to support or falsify your theoretical model?
  
Why is this question important? If we learned the answer, what part of the world would we understand better (in other words, what subgraph of a model of the world would we know something new about or be more confident in?). 
  
**Data strategy**

Do you have a treatment assignment scheme in mind? At what level will you randomize? How many units can be assigned to each condition? 

Do you have a measurement scheme in mind? What variables will you measure? With what instrument? 

What is the ideal experiment you would run, if there were no constraints? (This exercise may help to stimulate ideas both about experiments you could feasibly run and what observational designs might mimic this ideal experiment.)
  
**Answer strategy**

How will you use the data that results from your proposed data strategy to produce answers to your inquiry?
