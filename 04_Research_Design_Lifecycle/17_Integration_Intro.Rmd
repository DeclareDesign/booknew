# Integration

After publication, research studies leave the hands of researchers and enter the public domain. 

Most immediately, authors share their findings with the public through the media and with decisionmakers. Design information is useful for helping journalists to emphasize design quality rather than splashy findings. Decisionmakers may act on evidence from studies, and researchers who want to influence policymaking and business decisions may wish to consider diagnosands about the decisions these actors make.

Researchers can prepare for the integration of their studies into scholarly debates through better archiving practices and better reporting of research designs in the published article. Future researchers may build on the results of a past study in three ways. First, they may *reanalyze* the original data. Reanalysts must be cognizant of the original data strategy *D* when working with the realized data $d$. Changes to the the answer strategy *A* must respect *D*, regardless of whether the purpose of the reanalysis is to answer the original inquiry *I* or to answer a different inquiry $I'$. Second, future researchers may *replicate* the design. Typically, replicators provide a new answer to the same *I* with new data, possibly improving elements of *D* and *A* along the way. If the inquiry of the replication is too different from the inquiry of the original study, the fidelity of the replication study may be compromised. Lastly, future researchers may *meta-analyze* study's answer with other past studies. Meta-analysis is most meaningful when all of the included studies target a similar enough inquiry and when all studies rely on credible design. Otherwise, the procedure produces a meta-analytic average that is difficult to interpret.

All three of these activities depend on an accurate understanding of the study design. Reanalysts, replicators, and meta-analysts all need access to the study data and materials, of course. They also need to be sure of the critical design information in *M*, *I*, *D*, and *A*. Later in this section, we outline how archiving procedures that preserve study data and study design can enable new scientific purposes and describe strategies for doing each of these three particular integration tasks.




<!-- Consideration of how the findings will eventually be communicated --- and how policymakers, businesses, and regular people will use the findings to make decisions --- may change the research design.  Ex-ante consideration of communication plans will ensure designs target both scientific publication and decisionmaking by nonscientists. -->
