The designs and results of past studies are important guides for selecting M, I, D, and A. Our understanding of the nodes and edges in the causal graph of M, expected effect sizes, the distribution of outcomes, feasible randomization schemes, and many other features are directly selected from past research or chosen based on a literature review of the distribution over past studies. However, researchers face a problem in being guided by past research: the research context and our inquiries often differ in at least subtle ways from any past study. Even when we are replicating a past study, we are collecting data in a different time period and if effects vary over time then aspects of M may differ from the original study. To deal with this, we often run pilot studies. These take many forms: focus groups to learn about features of M or to learn how to ask survey questions; small-scale tests of measurement tools to verify our data collection technology works; up to mini studies with the planned design but on a smaller scale. 

Pilot studies are constrained by our time and by money. If we were not constrained, we would run the full study and learn what is wrong with our design and then run a corrected design for the main study. Since we cannot due to our constraints, we run either smaller mini studies or test out only a subset of the elements of our planned design. This places us in a bind: we are running a design smaller or less complete than the study we imagine conducting, and so the properties of the pilot design will not measure up. 

MIDA provides a framework for thinking about two aspects of piloting: what can be learned from a pilot? And what are the properties of the joint research design of pilot plus main study?

Diagnosing the pilot study on its own provides stark insights, which amount to: we cannot provide answers to the inquiry in the main study, and should not try to do so. There are also aspects of the logistics of research that within time and financial constraints we simply cannot learn until we run the main study. Science is imperfect, and also iterative, but these mistakes or suboptimal design choices also often lead to discoveries.

-- how does it help to diagnose the design together? the properties of the main study *change* when we do a pilot. This is because if we run the pilot study, we are doing so to make decisions about how to run the main study, and so our *design* of the main study and thus its results may depend on the *results* (and design) of the pilot study. 

In this section, we illustrate several general principles that flow from diagnosing pilot studies. 

Purposes of pilot studies:

Existence proofs:
-- is there variation in Y
-- is there variation in X
-- what are nodes in M
-- what are feasible D's, what are feasible treatments / can you implement the treatment (existence proof)

Harder questions requiring bigger sample sizes:
-- what is the distribution of X (helps select stratification proportions etc.)
-- what is the standard deviation of Y0

#### Assessing a pilot design

declare pilot itself and diagnose just as if it were the main study

if you can't learn the answer, don't make any decisions based on it

#### Assessing a sequenced design

if you are making decisions about MIDA for main study based on pilot, diagnose the procedure of two studies, think about POs of pilot

#### Pilots and baselines

Designs can be reassessed after baselines and before treatment assignment -- so some of the questions you might do a pilot for can just be answered in a baseline

Data collection is expensive, and we often only get one bite at the apple. In response, we often conduct an inexpensive (and small) pilot test to help better design the study. Pilot studies have many virtues, including practicing the logistics of data collection and improving measurement tools. But using pilots to get noisy estimates in order to determine sample sizes for scale up comes with risks.

Pilot studies are often used to get a guess of the average effect size, which is then plugged into power calculators when designing the full study.

The procedure is:

1. Conduct a small pilot study (say, N = 50)
2. Obtain an estimate of the effect size (this is noisy, but better than nothing!)
3. Conduct a power analysis for a larger study (say, N = 500) on the basis of the estimated effect size in the pilot

We show in this post that this procedure turns out to be dangerous: at common true effect sizes found in the social sciences, you are at risk of selecting an underpowered design based on the noisy effect estimate in your pilot study.

A different procedure has better properties:

1. Conduct a small pilot study (say, N = 50)
2. Obtain an estimate of the **standard deviation of the outcome variable** (again, this is a noisy estimate but better than nothing!)
3. Estimate the minimum detectable effect (MDE) for a larger study (say, N = 500), using the estimated standard deviation

We show what happens in each procedure, using DeclareDesign. In each case, we'll think about a decision the researcher wants to make based on the pilot: should I move forward with my planned study, or should I go back to the drawing board? We'll rely on power to make that decision in the first procedure and the MDE in the second procedure.

For each true effect size, the simulations will give us a distribution of estimated effects that a researcher might use as a basis for power analysis. For example, for a true effect size of 0 the researcher might still estimate an effect of 0.10, and so conduct their power analysis assuming that the true effect is 0.10. For each true effect, we can thus construct a distribution of *power estimates* a researcher might obtain from *estimated* effects. Since we know the true power for the true underlying effect, we can compare the distribution of post-hoc power estimates to the true power one would estimate if one knew the true effect size.


What did we find? In the plot, we show our guesses for the power of the main study based on our pilot effect size estimates. 

At high true effect sizes (top row), we do pretty well. Most of our guesses are above 80\% power, leading us to the correct decision that the study is powered. Indeed we often *underestimate* our power in these cases meaning that we run larger studies than we need to.

However, at low true effect sizes (bottom row) we show we are equally likely to find that the design is in fact powered as underpowered. We are equally likely to guess the power of the design is 90% as 10%. There is a good chance that we will falsely infer that our design is well powered just because we happened to get a high estimate from a noisy pilot.


# How about estimating the standard deviation of the outcome?

Now, let's look at the second approach. Here, instead of using our pilot study to estimate the effect size for a power calculation, we estimate the **standard deviation of the outcome** and use this to calculate the main study's minimum detectable effect. The decision we want to make is: is this MDE small enough to be able to rule out substantively important effects?

We calculate the minimum detectable effect size using the approximation from [@gelman2006data, pg. 441], 2.8 times the estimated standard error. We estimate the standard error using Equation 3.6 from @gerber2012field. 



In summary, pilot studies can be valuable in planning research for many reasons, but power calculations based on noisy effect size estimates can be misleading. A better approach is to use the pilot to learn about the distribution of outcome variables. The variability of the outcome variable can then be plugged into MDE formulas or even power calculations with, say, the smallest effect size of political, economic, or social importance.

In the same spirit, pilot studies could also be used to learn the strength of the correlation between pre-treatment covariates and the outcome variable. With this knowledge in hand, researchers can develop their expectations about how much precision there is to be gained from covariate control or blocking.
