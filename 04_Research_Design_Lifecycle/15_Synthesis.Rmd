One of the last, if not the last, stage of the lifecyle of a research design is its eventual incorportation in to our common scientific understanding of the world. Research findings about specific Is -- specific $a^D$s need to be synthesized into our broader scientific understanding.

Research synthesis takes two basic forms. The first is meta-analysis, in which a series of $a^D$s are analyzed together in order to better understand features of the distribution of answers obtained in the literature. Traditional meta-analysis typically focuses on the average of k answers: $a_1^D$,$a_2^D$,...$a_k^D$. Studies can be averaged together in many ways that are better and worse. Sometimes the answers are averaged together according to their precision -- a precision weighted average of estimates from many studies is equivalent to fixed-effects meta analysis. Sometimes studies are "averaged" by counting up how many of the estimates are positive and significant, how many are negative and significant, and how many are null. This is the typical averaging approach taken in a literature review. Regardless of the averaging approach, the goal of this kind of synthesis is to learn as much as possible about a particular $I$ by drawing on evidence from many studies.

A second kind of synthesis is an attempt to bring together many $a^D$, each of which targets a different Inquiry about a common Model. This is the kind of synthesis that takes place across an entire research literature. Different scholars focus on different nodes and edges of the common model, so a synthesis needs to incorporate the diverse sources of evidence.

How can you best anticipate how your research findings will be synthesized? For the first kind of synthesis -- meta analysis -- you must be cognizant of keeping a commonly understood $I$ in mind. You want to select inquiries not for their novelty, but because of their commonly-understood importance. We want *many* studies on the effects of having women versus men elected officials on public goods because we want to understand this particular $I$ in great detail and specificity. While the specifics of the models $M$ might differ from study to study, the fact that the $I$s are all similar enough to be synthesized allows for a specific kind of knowledge accumulation.

For the second kind of synthesis -- literature-wide progress on a full causal model -- even greater care is required. Specific studies cannot make up bespoke models $M$ but instead must understand how the specific $M$ adopted in the study is a specical case of some master $M$ that is in principle agreed to by a wider research community. The nonstop, neverending proliferation of study-specific theories is a threat to this kind of knowledge accumulation. (Cite cyrus on causal empiricism, that psych paper on crazy proliferation of theories).





A research synthesis is a "meta MIDA"

M: A master Model that subsumes portions of the sub Ms?
I: This is a summary of all of the Is across the stueis.
D: This is the inclusion / exclusion criteria. Transformations of the study data. standardization. (sampling, measurement.)
A: things like Random effects, fixed effects, Quimpo.


$I_1 \approx I_2 \approx I_3$

Not

$a^M_1 \approx a^M_2 \approx a^M_3$


Meta-analysis can be used not just to guess about effects out-of-sample but also to re-evaluate effects in sample: https://declaredesign.org/blog/2018-12-11-meta-analysis.html
