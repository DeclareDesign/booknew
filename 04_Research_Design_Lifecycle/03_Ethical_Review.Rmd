## Ethical Review

<!-- make sure to rename the section title below -->

```{r ethical_review, echo = FALSE, output = FALSE, purl = FALSE}
# run the diagnosis (set to TRUE) on your computer for this section only before pushing to Github. no diagnosis will ever take place on github.
do_diagnosis <- FALSE
sims <- 100
b_sims <- 20
```

```{r, echo = FALSE}
# load packages for this section here. note many (DD, tidyverse) are already available, see scripts/package-list.R
```

- Ethical review includes more than just the IRB.
- We discussed in the data strategy section how different data strategies may be more or less ethically encumbered.
- We discussed in the diagnosis section how expected ethical downsides can be formalized as diagnosands so that researchers can choose the best design among the "ethical" studies; or if designs can't be discretized into ethical and non ethical, researchers can explicitly consider how much cost they are willing to impose on subjects to learn truths.
- It's important to communicate your design choices so that they can specifically evaluate your ethical judgements. It's difficult for others to understand (a) your design and (b) what the ethical tradeoffs truly entail. Declared designs help immensely because they focus attention on what part, exactly, people are responding to.

- Is it the measurement they object to? Is it the random assignemtn?
