A vital part of the research design process is gathering criticism and feedback from others. Timing is delicate here. Asking for comments on a project that is underdeveloped can sometimes lead to brainstorming sessions about what research questions one might look into -- possibly quite useful, but essentially restarts the research design lifecycle from the beginning. Sharing work only after a full draft has been produced is worse, since the data strategy will have already produced the realized data $d$ and the investigators may have become attached to favored answer strategies and interpretations. Feedback can only help a project so much if the fieldwork has already been conducted, the treatments have already been allocated, or the outcomes have already been measured. While critics can always suggest changes to $I$ and $A$ post-data collection, an almost-finished project is fundamentally constrained by the data strategy as it was implemented.

The best moments to seek advice come before the registration of preanalysis plans or, if not registering, before the implementation of major data strategy elements. The point is not to seek advice exclusively on sampling, assignment, or measurement procedures -- it's that when there's still time to modify those design elements, feedback about the design as a whole can inform changes to the data strategy. 

Feedback will come in many forms. Sometimes the comments are directly about diagnosands -- the critic may think the design has too many arms and so won't be well-powered for many inquiries. The critic may be concerned about bias due to excludability violations or selection issues. These comments are especially useful because they can easily be incorporated in design diagnosis and redesign activities.

Other comments are harder to pin down. A fruitful exercise in such cases is to understand how the criticism fits in to M, I, D, and A. A comment like, "I'm concerned about external validity here" might seem to be about the data strategy -- since the units weren't randomly sampled from some well-specified population, we can't generalize from the sample to the population. But if the inquiry is not actually a population quantity, then this inability to use sample data to estimate a population quantity is irrelevant. Now the question is whether knowing the answer to your sample inquiry helps make theoretical progress, or whether we need to switch the inquiry to the population quantity in order to make headway. Critics will not usually be specific about how their criticism relates to M, I, D, or A, so it is up to the person seeking feedback to understand the implications of the criticism for the design.

Sometimes we seek feedback from smart people, but they do not immediately understand the design setting. If the critic hasn't absorbed or taken into account important features of the design, their recommendations and amendments may be off base. For this reason, it's important to communicate the design features -- the model, inquiry, data strategy, and answer strategy -- at a high enough level of detail that the critic is up to speed before passing judgment.
