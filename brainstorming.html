<!-- make sure to rename the section title below -->
<p>The hardest part of starting research is finding an idea, a kernel of a project. An idea may come in the form of a piece of a model, an inquiry, a part of a data strategy, or a part of an answer strategy or a combination. Ideas come from primary observation of social processes; reading secondary accounts by other authors in books, journal articles, magazines, and newspapers; and from our own past thoughts and experiences.</p>
<p>An idea in the form of a model includes one or more nodes and one or more edges between them: I believe D affects Y or D affects Y because M or Y is distributed normal with mean 5 and standard deviation 3. An inquiry is perhaps the most common kernel of a research project, and might be “does D cause Y”. A data strategy might be the discovery of a discontinuity in the rule for offering food stamps or that a partner organization can randomize canvassers to talk with voters about a ballot measure on property taxes. A research project that starts with an answer strategy might be the discovery of a new technique for audio analysis that enables answering questions about the relationship between the content and emotional tenor of speech.</p>
<p>With the idea in hand, the next step in the research process is to develop a complete research design. With a model, the researcher needs to select an inquiry, data strategy, and answer strategy that can distinguish among that model and alternative possible models or in other words to falsify it. With only a kernel of a model, say, two nodes and an edge between them, the research can expand the model to include mechanisms and moderators, confounders and colliders.
When the inquiry is the kernel, you can, similarly, build a model out from the nodes and edges defined in the inquiry. …</p>

<ul>
<li>much standard research advice cautions against selecting a data strategy or answer strategy, because it is thought ot lead to work that does not meet the goal of informing theory. it need not have this problem.</li>
</ul>
<p>The aim of research is to inform theory or practice. Basic research aims to build better theories of how humans think, behave, and interact, whether or not there are practical implications of that learning. In applied research, we apply theories developed in basic research to particular problems or contexts. Though these non-researchers may not consciously hold theoretical models in the same way researchers do, they do have mental models of how the world works that can be influenced by research. Many researchers, directly or indirectly, aim to influence the decisions of policymakers, businesses, governments, or individuals, by shifting these mental models. Thus, in one way or another, the aim of research is to build better models of the world, whether formalized as theory or not.</p>
<p>Given this goal of research to build better models, a useful way to select inquiries is to find ones that distinguish between different models. A simple example is that you might have a model which says that D causes Y and another that, instead, D does not cause Y. An inquiry that distinguishes these two models is: does D cause Y?</p>
<p>two ways to start:
– start with a theory and identify inquiries that will rule out alternatives
– start with an identified result and built up to a theory</p>
<p>Brainstorming sessions can be useful to take a kernel of idea and identify a set of possible research designs building on it. These candidate designs can then be diagnosed and assessed for feasibility. But what do participants in the brainstorming session need to know about your idea so they can effectively help identify possible designs? We suggest using the following “problem statement”, where the core task is to place your kernel of an idea into MIDA.<a class="footnote-ref" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content="&lt;p&gt;The problem statement idea was developed by Graeme Blair, Darin Christensen, Erin Hartman, and Chad Hazlett for a research design seminar at UCLA. &lt;/p&gt;"><sup>26</sup></a> You need not have all the parts of MIDA — that’s why you are having a brainstorming session! But systematizing what you do know is helpful.</p>
<ul>
<li>it’s not usually helpful to have just an answer strategy</li>
<li>if cannot specify any of M, I, or D, it will usually be hard to help. a common situation is having a context or a topic of interest. this is fine! but this may not be enough to yield a productive brainstorming session about designs, because the other participants will not know what part <em>you</em> are interested in. we can all imagine many theoretical ideas, research questions, and research strategies that would be of interest to ourselves, but until you specify a theoretical kernel, an inquiry, or a data strategy we can’t fill in the rest of the blanks for you.</li>
</ul>
<div class="FOO">
<p><strong>Problem statement</strong></p>
<p><strong>Model</strong></p>
<p>What is the population of units of interest? How many are there? What are their characteristics?</p>
<p>What is your theoretical model?
- Draw a graphical representation of this part of the model (see Chapter 5). What are the variables that matter? Are they causally connected? In which direction? What parts are you confident in based on past work or your observations and what parts do you want to learn about from the design?</p>
<p><strong>Inquiry</strong></p>
<p>What are your research questions?
- If you have a model (above), express your question in terms of the variables in your model.
- If you started with a model, what are all of the inquiries that are implied by the model, that would provide empirical evidence to support or falsify your theoretical model?</p>
<p>Why is this question important? If we learned the answer, what part of the world would we understand better (in other words, what subgraph of a model of the world would we know something new about or be more confident in?).</p>
<p><strong>Data strategy</strong></p>
<p>Do you have a treatment assignment scheme in mind? At what level will you randomize? How many units can be assigned to each condition?</p>
<p>Do you have a measurement scheme in mind? What variables will you measure? With what instrument?</p>
<p>What is the ideal experiment you would run, if there were no constraints? (This exercise may help to stimulate ideas both about experiments you could feasibly run and what observational designs might mimic this ideal experiment.)</p>
<p><strong>Answer strategy</strong></p>
How will you use the data that results from your proposed data strategy to produce answers to your inquiry?
