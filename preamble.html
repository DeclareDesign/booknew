<p>With this book, we introduce a way of thinking about research designs in the social sciences that can make designs more transparent and more robust. Our hope is that this approach will make designing research studies easier: making it easier to produce good designs, but also easier to share designs and build off of the designs that others have developed.</p>
<p>The core idea of this book is to start to think of a design as an object that can be interrogated. This object has four main characteristics: its model, its inquiry, its data strategy, and its answer strategy. We have to understand each of the four on their own and also how they interrelate. The design encodes your beliefs about the world, it describes your questions, and it lays out how you go about answering those questions, in terms of both what data you use and how you use it. A key idea is that all of these features can be provided in code and—if done right—the information provided is enough to estimate the quality of the design through simulation.</p>
<p>We think this way of thinking about research design pays dividends at multiple points in the research lifecycle: Choosing a question, synthesizing previous answers, conducting an ethics review, piloting parts of the empirical strategy, crafting a preanalysis plan, implementing the study, summarizing the results, writing the paper, publishing the result, archiving the materials, engaging with critical scholarship.</p>

<span class="header-section-number">1.1</span> How to read this book<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#how-to-read-this-book"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h2>
<p>We had multiple audiences in mind when writing this book. First, we’re thinking of college seniors who have to produce a course research paper. These students need a framework for thinking about the ways each part of the research process fit together. We’re also thinking of graduate students in seminar courses where the main purpose of the course is to read papers and discuss how well the theory matches the empirics. The MIDA framework introduced in Part I is a way to structure both tasks that accommodates many different empirical approaches: qualitative and quantitative, descriptive and causal, observational and experimental. If we only had 30 minutes with a person to try and get them to understand what our book is about, we would give them Part I.</p>
<p>Part II is more involved. We provide the mathematical foundations of the MIDA framework. We walk through each component of a research design in detail: Models, Inquiries, Data strategies, and Answer Strategies. We describe the finer points of research design diagnosis and how to carry out a “redesign.” We imagine that Part II could be assigned early in a graduate course on research design in any of the social sciences.</p>
<p>In Part III, we apply the general framework to specific research designs. The result is a library of common research designs. Many empirical research designs are included in the library, but not all. The set of entries covers a large portion of what we see in current empirical practice, but it is not meant to be exhaustive. We are thinking of two kinds of audiences for the design library. The first is the researcher who wants to know how a specific research design operates and what to watch out for. They turn to the ``regression discontinuity’’ entry and learn the ten most important things to know about the design. These 10 most important things are not <strong>everything</strong> there is to know about the design. For that, we refer at the end of each entry to a set of the most up-to-date methodological treatments of the topic. The entry will help you simulate the design’s properties and explore design tradeoffs before implementing it. The second reader we have in mind is a person who is studying the entry not to learn the specifics of the regression discontinuity design necessarily, but instead to learn to become a research designer. The regression discontinuity entry is an <strong>instance</strong> of a research design from which general lessons about research design can be drawn. Readers who want to be research designers should read through the design library in its entirety.</p>
<p>The last section of the book describes in detail how our framework can help at each step of the research process. Each of these sections of the book should be readable for anyone who has read Part I. The entry on preanalysis plans can be assigned in an experiments course as guidance for students filing their first PAP. The entry on research ethics could be shared among coauthors at the start of a project. The entry on writing a research paper could be assigned to college seniors trying to finish their essays on time.</p>

</h2>
<p>At many times throughout the book, we will describe research designs not just in words, but in computer code.
<!-- You can read all of Part I without any coding, but some aspects of Part II and Part III are enhanced by engaging with the code.  -->
If you want to work through all of the code and exercises, fantastic. This path requires investment in <code>R</code>, the <code>tidyverse</code> and the <code>DeclareDesign</code> sets of software packages. Chapter <a href="primer.html#primer">3</a> helps get you started. We think doing it this way is very rewarding, but we understand that there is a learning curve. You could, of course, tackle the declaration, diagnosis, and redesign processes using bespoke simulations in any computer language you like,<a class="footnote-ref" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content="&lt;p&gt;On our Web site, we provide examples in &lt;code&gt;R&lt;/code&gt;, Python, Stata, and Excel.&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>1</sup></a> but it is easier in <code>DeclareDesign</code>.</p>
<p>If you want nothing to do with the code, you can skip all the code and exercises to just focus on the text. We have written the book so that understanding of the code is not required in order to understand research design concepts.
<!-- If you choose this path, we promise our way of thinking about research design is useful even without any code. --></p>
<p>The free, online version of this book has many extra ways to engage with the material. You can download any section of code and you can play with interactive simulations. These bells and whistles are not necessary for understanding, but we all learn in different ways.</p>

<p>This is a book about research design, not a statistics textbook. We will not derive estimators, we will provide no guarantees of the general optimality of designs, and we will present no mathematical proofs. Nor will we provide all the answers to all the practical questions you might have about your design.</p>
<p>What we do offer, we hope, is a language to express research designs. We can help you to learn that language so you can describe your own design in it. When you can declare your design in this language, then you can diagnose it, then improve it through a redesign.</p>
