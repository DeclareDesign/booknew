<!-- note do_bookdown is set in index.rmd, so we know if you're running just this .Rmd or compiling the book-->
```{r, eval = !exists("do_bookdown"), echo = FALSE, include = FALSE, purl = FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE, cache = FALSE)
knitr::opts_knit$set(root.dir = rprojroot::find_rstudio_root_file()) # files are all relative to RStudio project home
```

```{r, eval = !exists("do_bookdown"), echo = FALSE, include = FALSE, purl = FALSE}
# load common packages, set ggplot ddtheme, etc.
source("scripts/before_chapter_script.R")
```

## Section title in sentence case

<!-- make sure to rename the section title below -->

```{r section_title, echo = FALSE, output = FALSE, purl = FALSE}
# run the diagnosis (set to TRUE) on your computer for this section only before pushing to Github. no diagnosis will ever take place on github.
do_diagnosis <- FALSE
sims <- 100
b_sims <- 20
```

```{r, echo = FALSE}
# load packages for this section here. note many (DD, tidyverse) are already available, see scripts/package-list.R
library(blockTools)
```

You can use the global bib file via rmarkdown cites like this: @imai2008

```{r}
design <-
  declare_model(N = 100, u = rnorm(N)) +
  declare_potential_outcomes(Y ~ Z + u) +
  declare_assignment(prob = 0.5) +
  declare_reveal(Y, Z) +
  declare_estimator(Y ~ Z, model = difference_in_means)
```


This chunk is set to `echo = TRUE` and `eval = do_diagnosis`
```{r, eval = do_diagnosis & !exists("do_bookdown")}
simulations_pilot <- simulate_design(design, sims = sims)
```

Right after you do simulations, you want to save the simulations rds. 

```{r, echo = FALSE, purl = FALSE}
# figure out where the dropbox path is, create the directory if it doesn't exist, and name the RDS file
rds_file_path <- paste0(get_dropbox_path("section_template"), "/simulations_pilot.RDS")
if (do_diagnosis & !exists("do_bookdown")) {
  write_rds(simulations_pilot, file = rds_file_path)
}
simulations_pilot <- read_rds(rds_file_path)
```

Now all that simulating, saving, and loading is done, and we can use the simulations for whatever you want.

```{r}
kable(head(simulations_pilot))
```
