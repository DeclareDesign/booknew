<!-- make sure to rename the section title below -->
<p>When writing up an empirical paper, the authors must convince reviewers and readers that the question is important and that the research design they selected provides useful answers to the question. This is where MIDA comes in. Elements of MIDA will appear in every section of a paper, and every element of MIDA should be described somewhere in the paper.</p>
<p>A common model for social science empirical papers has five sections: an introduction, theory and hypotheses, research design, results, and discussion. We outline how elements of MIDA can usefully fit into each section here, before providing an example paper highlighting where each element was described.</p>
<p>The introduction section should have a capitulation of each aspect of MIDA in brief. The reader is brought quickly up to speed on the whole research design, as well as expectations and actual findings.</p>
<p>The next section, theory and hypotheses, contains information about the causal model of the world (<span class="math inline">\(M\)</span>) and the research question about the world (<span class="math inline">\(I\)</span>) as well as guesses about <span class="math inline">\(a^M\)</span> (i.e., hypotheses!). The section should lay out all of the features of the model necessary to describe <span class="math inline">\(I\)</span>.</p>
<p>To motivate hypotheses, the theory section should outline our prior beliefs about <span class="math inline">\(a^W\)</span>, the true answer to the inquiry, based on past literature. A meta-analysis or systematic review of past evidence could provide a systematic summary of past answers to <span class="math inline">\(a^W\)</span>, or an informal literature review could be offered. These priors are used along with the study results to construct posterior beliefs reported in the discussion section, i.e., what we know after conducting the study. In summarizing the literature, it is important to consider the research designs of past studies (see Synthesis section). Meta-analyses often formally account for the quality of the research designs of past studies by weighting by the inverse of their precision (upweighting informative studies and down-weighting uninformative ones). Literature reviews may do so informally. Moreover, the summary of past literature is itself a research design, and so we should try to prevent common research design issues such as selection on the dependent variable by ensuring we discuss all literature and not only present views consonant with our hypotheses.</p>
<p>Though research questions are nearly ubiquitously included, details of the model are often left out. Expected effect sizes, how effects vary by subgroups, expected proportions of subgroups, how variables are expected to be correlated, and the amount of variability in the outcome are some of the features of the model that will have important effects on how reviewers and readers judge the quality of the research design. Without specifying these portions of <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span>, a diagnosis cannot be conducted. Moreover, we describe in Reanalysis, when you define <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span> yourself in your paper, you can clarify the terms of the debate about alternative analysis strategies. When <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span> is undefined, the author of the reanalysis must infer your model or make up their own, and you may not agree.</p>
<p>The research design or methods section should have a description of <span class="math inline">\(D\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> and a description of a diagnosis of the design. In this section, we defend our choice of <span class="math inline">\(D\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> under <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(I\)</span>. Papers commonly have more than one <span class="math inline">\(D\)</span> and associated <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> answering the same or related questions; both <span class="math inline">\(D\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> for each should be described in this section.</p>
<p>The results section describes <span class="math inline">\(a^D\)</span>. Increasingly, results are presented visually as well as in text, in order to effectively communicate the results to the reader. Visualizing the modeled results as well as the raw data can both improve how the results are communicated and simultaneously help readers connect the research design, the data, and the results.</p>
<p>The discussion is where we update our understanding of the model and form our posteriors about <span class="math inline">\(a^W\)</span> given our prior expectations and the results <span class="math inline">\(a^D\)</span>. We may learn from the study about new variables and new edges that matter in the model — new outcomes that are affected by a treatment. We also often learn more about the functional form of causal relationships between two variables, for example from new moderators or more precision on the size of the moderation. The discussion section is also a chance to point to new MIDAs that could be implemented to learn more about <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span>. These might relate to new nodes we discovered, or parts of the model that we did not yet learn enough about.</p>

</div>
<p>In Figure XX, we illustrate where elements of MIDA are incorporated into <span class="citation">Mousa (<a href="references-4.html#ref-mousa2020building">2020</a>)</span>. The study reports on the outcome of a randomized experiment in which Iraqi Christians were assigned either to an all-Christian soccer team or a team in which they would play alongside Muslims. The experiment tested whether being on a mixed team affected intergroup attitudes and behaviors, both among teammates and back at home after the games were over. We highlight in color areas discussing the model <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span> in yellow, the inquiry <span class="math inline">\(I\)</span> in green, the data strategy <span class="math inline">\(D\)</span> in blue, and the answer strategy <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> in pink.</p>
<p>The model and the inquiry largely appear in the abstract and introductory portion of the paper, though aspects of the model are discussed later on. Much of the first three pages are devoted to the data strategy, while the answer strategy only appears briefly. This division makes sense: in this paper, the action is all in the experimental design whereas the answer strategy follows straightforwardly from it using the principles of analyze as you randomize. The paper mostly describes <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(D\)</span>, with only a small portion devoted to <span class="math inline">\(I\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span>. Finally, it is notable that the data strategy is interspersed with aspects of the model. The reason is that the author is justifying choices about randomization and measurement using features of the model. This highlights the deep connection between the two discussed in Part II.</p>
<p>Papers often report on the results from multiple data strategies and others on the answers to multiple related inquiries. Typically, a single <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span> should be described in the theory section, which describes how the nodes and edges used in each of the <span class="math inline">\(I\)</span>’s fit together. Each data and strategy should be described, and which inquiries each answer strategy is targeting. Each estimate should be linked to one or more inquiries. In some cases, the reason why multiple inquiries are studied in a single paper is that the aim of the paper is to falsify a model of the world. In this case, the model should be described and the diagnosis of the design should include an assessment of how good the <em>overall</em> design, with data and answer strategies to generate answers to each inquiry, is at falsifying the model. Psychology three-study papers often take this form: study 1 asks about the correlation between X and Y, in study 2 X is randomized, and in study 3 an analysis of the mechanisms that lead between X and Y are examined.</p>
<!-- Big ideas: -->
<!-- - make sure to have all of MIDA in your paper! -->
<!-- - please keep kosher.  Theory section material belongs in the theory section, not in the design or results section, etc. -->

<!-- 9 Appendices and robustness -->
