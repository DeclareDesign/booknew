<p>In many research communities, it is becoming standard practice to publicly register a pre-analysis plan (PAP) prior to the implementation of some or all of the data strategy. PAPs serve many functions, but most importantly, they clarify which design choices were made before data collection and which were made afterward. Sometimes – perhaps every time! – we conduct a research study, aspects of <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(I\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(D\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> shift along the way. A concern is that they shift in ways that invalidate the apparent conclusions of the study. For example, “<span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>-hacking” is the shady practice of trying out many regression specifications until the <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>-value associated with an important test attains statistical significance. PAPs protect researchers by communicating to skeptics <em>when</em> design decisions were made: if the regression specification was detailed in a PAP posted before any data were collected, the test cannot be the result of a <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>-hack.</p>
<p>PAPs are sometimes misinterpreted as a binding commitment to report all pre-registered analyses and nothing but. This view is unrealistic and unnecessarily rigid. While we think that researchers should report all pre-registered analyses <em>somewhere</em> (see Section <a href="during.html#p4populatedpap">22.3</a> on “populated PAPs”), study write-ups inevitably deviate in some way from the PAP – and that’s a good thing. Researchers learn more by conducting research; this learning can and should be reflected in the finalized answer strategy. Even if not binding, the main point of publicly posting pre-analysis plan is to communicate at what stage in the research process choices were made.</p>
<p>Our hunch is that the main consequence of actually writing a PAP is the improvement of the research design itself. Just like research design declaration forces us to think through the details of our model, inquiry, data strategy, and answer strategy, describing those choices in a publicly-posted document surely causes deeper reflection about the design. In this way, the main audience for a PAP is the study authors themselves.</p>
<p>What belongs in a PAP? Recommendations for the set of decisions that should be specified in a PAP remain remarkably unclear and inconsistent across research communities. PAP templates and checklists are proliferating, and the number of items they suggest range from nine to sixty. PAPs themselves are becoming longer and more detailed, with some in the American Economic Association (AEA) and Evidence in Governance and Politics (EGAP) study registries reaching hundreds of pages as researchers seek to be ever more comprehensive. Some registries emphasize the registration of the hypotheses to be tested, while others emphasize the registration of the tests that will used. We read many PAPs and found it is hard to assess whether these detailed plans actually contain the key analytically-relevant details.</p>
<p>Our view is, minimally, a PAP should include a design declaration. A good deal of the discussion of what goes in a PAP centers on the answer strategy <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> – what estimator to use, what covariates to condition on, what subsets of the data to include. But of course we also need to know the details of <span class="math inline">\(D\)</span> – how units were sampled, how treatments were assigned, how the outcomes will be measured. We need these details to assess the properties of the design and also to gauge whether the principles of analyze as you randomize are being followed. We need to know about <span class="math inline">\(I\)</span> because we need to know the target of inference.<a class="footnote-ref" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content="&lt;p&gt;A major concern in medical trials is “outcome switching,” wherein the eventual report focuses on different health outcomes that originally intended. When we switch outcomes, we switch inquiries!&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>23</sup></a> We need enough of <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span> to describe <span class="math inline">\(I\)</span> in sufficient detail. In short, a design declaration is what belongs in a PAP, because a design declaration specifies all of the analytically-relevant design decisions.</p>
<p>In addition to a design declaration, a PAP should include mock analyses conducted on simulated data. If the design declaration is done formally in code, creating simulated data that resemble the eventual realized data is quite straightforward. We think researchers should run their answer strategy on the mock data, creating mock figures and tables that will eventually be made with real data. In our experience, <em>this</em> is the step that really causes researchers to think hard about all aspects of their design.</p>
<p>Strictly speaking, preanalysis plans should include design declaration, but they do not <em>require</em> design diagnosis. But since the design that is finally settled on as the design to be implemented is usually chosen as the result of a diagnosis, it can be informative to describe, in a preanalysis plan, the reasons why the particular design was chosen. For this reason, a PAP might include estimates of diagnosands like power, RMSE, or bias. If a researcher writes in a PAP that the power to detect a very small effect is large, then if the study comes back null, the eventual writeup can much more credibly rule out “low power” as an explanation for the null. Moreover, ex ante design diagnosis communicates the assumptions under which they thought the design was a good one before they ran the study. These reasons are often the basis on which we convince skeptics of the value of the design, so writing them down <em>before</em> the results are known increases the faith we put in them.</p>

</h3>
<p>In this section, we provide an example of how to supplement a PAP with design declaration. We follow the actual PAP for <span class="citation">Bonilla and Tillery (<a href="references.html#ref-bonilla_tillery_2020" role="doc-biblioref">2020</a>)</span>, which was posted to the As Predicted registry here: <a href="https://aspredicted.org/q56qq.pdf" class="uri">https://aspredicted.org/q56qq.pdf</a>. The goal of the study is to estimate the causal effects of alternative framings of the Black Lives Matter (BLM) movement on support for the movement among Black Americans overall as well as among subsets of the Black community. These study authors are models of research transparency: they prominently link to the PAP in the published article, they conduct no non-preregistered analyses except those requested during the review process, and their replication archive includes all materials required to confirm their analyses, all of which we were able to reproduce exactly with minimal effort. Our goal with this section is to show how design declaration can supplement and complement existing planning practices.</p>
<div id="model-2" class="section level4">
<h4>
<span class="header-section-number">21.1.1.1</span> Model<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#model-2"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h4>
<p>The authors write in their PAP:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We hypothesize that: H1: Black Nationalist frames of the BLM movement will increase perceived effectiveness of BLM among African American test subjects. H2: Feminist frames of the BLM movement will increase perceived effectiveness of BLM among African American women, but decrease perceived effectiveness in male subjects. H3: LGBTQ and Intersectional frames of the BLM movement will have no effect (or a demobilizing effect) on the perceived effectiveness of BLM African American subjects.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>These hypotheses reflect a model of coalition politics that emphasizes the tensions induced by overlapping identities. Framing the BLM movement as feminist or pro-LGBTQ may increase support among Black women or Black LGBTQ identifiers, but that increase may come at the expense of support among Black men or Blacks who do not identify as LGBTQ. Similarly, this model predicts that subjects with stronger attachment to their Black identity will have a larger response to a Black nationalist framing of BLM than those with weaker attachments.</p>
<p>The model also includes beliefs about the distributions of gender, LGBTQ status, and Black identity strength. In the Data strategy, Black identity will be measured with the standard linked fate measure. Other background characteristics that may be correlated with support for BLM include age, religiosity, income, education, and familiarity with the movement, so these are included in the model as well.</p>
<p>The focus of the study will be on the causal effects of the nationalism, feminism, and intersectional frames relative to a general description of the Black Lives Matter movement. Model beliefs about treatment effect heterogeneity are embedded in the <code>declare_potential_outcomes</code> call. The effect of the nationalism treatment is hypothesized to be stronger, the greater subjects’ sense of linked fate; the effect of the feminism treatment should be negative for men but positive for women; the effect of the intersectionality treatment should be positive for LGBTQ identifies, but negative for non-identifiers.</p>

<p>The inquiries for this study naturally include the average affects of all three treatments relative to the “general” framing, as well as the differences in average effects for subgroups. When describing their planned analyses, the authors write:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We will also look at differences in responses between those indicating a pre-treatment familiarity BLM (4-Extensive knowledge to 1-Never heard of BLM), gender (particularly on the Feminist treatment), linked fate (particularly on the Nationalist treatment), and LGBT+ affiliation (particularly on the LGBT+ treatment), though we are not necessarily expecting these moderations to have a strong effect because samples may lack adequate representation.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the code below, we specify how each treatment effect changes with its corresponding covariate <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> with <span class="math inline">\(\frac{\mathrm{cov}(\tau_i, X)}{\mathbb{V}(X)}\)</span>, which is identical to the difference-in-difference for the binary covariates (<code>female</code> and <code>lgbtq</code>) and is the slope of the best linear predictor of how the effect changes over the range of <code>linked_fate</code>, and <code>blm_familiarity</code> which we are treating as quasi-continuous here.</p>

<p>The subjects for this study are 800 Black Americans recruited by the survey firm Qualtrics using a quota sampling procedure. We elide this sampling step in our declaration – the 800 subjects are described by the <code>declare_population</code> call. The reason is that, as is common practice in the analysis of survey experiments on convenience samples, authors do not formally extrapolate out from their data to make generalizations about the population of Black Americans. The inquiries they study are sample average effects. If the authors had used a different sampling strategy, using random sampling through random digit dialing for example, we would have defined the population from which they were sampling and the random sampling procedure.</p>
<p>After subjects’ background characteristics are measured, they were assigned to one of four treatment conditions. Since the survey was conducted on Qualtrics, we assume that the authors used the built-in randomization tools, which typically use simple (Bernoulli) random assignment.</p>

<p>The authors write:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We will run an OLS regression predicting the support for, effectiveness of, and trust in BLM on each treatment condition. […] We will also look at differences in responses between those indicating a pre-treatment familiarity BLM (4-Extensive knowledge to 1-Never heard of BLM), gender (particularly on the Feminist treatment), linked fate (particularly on the Nationalist treatment), and LGBT+ affiliation (particularly on the LGBT+ treatment), though we are not necessarily expecting these moderations to have a strong effect because samples may lack adequate representation. We plan to conduct analyses without controls. As we will check for between group balance, we may also run OLS analyses with demographic controls (age, linked fate, gender, sexual orientation, religiosity, income, education, and ethnic or multi-racial backgrounds), and will report differences in OLS results.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In DeclareDesign, this corresponds to five estimators, with two shooting at the ATEs and three shooting at the differences-in-CATEs. We use OLS for all five – the majority of the code is bookkeeping to ensure we match the right regression coefficient with the appropriate estimand.</p>

<p>Finally, while a design diagnosis is not a necessary component of a preanalysis plan, it can be useful to show readers why a particular design was chosen over others. This diagnosis shows that the design produces unbiased estimates of all estimands, but that we are better powered from some inquires than others (under the above assumptions about effect size, which were our own and not the original authors’). We are well-powered for the average effects, and the power increases when we include covariate controls. The design is probably too small for most of the heterogeneous effect analyses, which is a point directly conceded in the authors’ original PAP.</p>

<!-- ## Debates over the value of PAPs --><!-- PAPs are often described as a tool for tying researchers' hand and reducing "researcher degrees of freedom" to seek out congenial analyses. PAPs are sometimes criticized because (A) they don't *actually* constrain what researchers do and (B) they *shouldn't*.   --><!-- PAPs might not actually constrain researchers because most journals and pressess do not check against PAPs. As reviewers, we have sometimes requested that authors send in the PAPs referenced in their papers. In nearly every case, some analyses promised in the PAP were not included, even in an appendix. Some analyses that appear in the paper were not included in the PAP. As we discuss in greater detail in section XXX on reconciliation, current practice is clearly too causal when distinguishing which analyses were pre-specified and which were not. --><!-- Some critics of PAPs charge that we shouldn't pre-register our analysis plans because we should be open to discovery. We learn once we arrive in the field what the interesting questions are, so we shouldn't be constrained by what we thought would happen when sitting in our offices. Furthermore, sometimes people pre-register analyses that are biased, misspecified, or are otherwise inappropriate, so they shouldn't be required to present them. We agree with all the above points -- researchers should create post-implementation reports (CITE JENS in PA) that follow the PAP. Analyses over and above the PAP should simply be labeled as such. --><!-- Our take is that PAPs are helpful tools for researchers to plan research better and they are useful for clarifying what the researcher was thinking at each stage.  --><!-- ## Other benefits of PAPS --><!-- - involving partners: agreeing on the analysis procedure ex ante reduces ex post conflict --><!-- - frontloading research design decisions (get more specific, identify problems) --><!-- - Anticipating what might go wrong: attrition, noncompliance, study failure, missing covariate data, etc. --><!-- - Faithful reanalysis. Reanalysts lose a degree of freedom in determining what an author might have intended by a given analysis.  --><!-- - Easier design comparison. If a design is declared at the preanalysis plan phase, then it enables direct comparison with the design as implemented in the final write-up. Side-by-side comparison of the code neatly clarifies which design choices were made ex-ante and ex-post. Side-by-side comparison of the performance of a planned and implemented designs clarify under what conditions deviations from plans are defensible improvements. --><!-- - ethics (summarize and cite Jay's ideas here: http://www.jasonlyall.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/PreregisterYourEthics.pdf) --><!-- - ethical outcomes are potential outcomes, so we need to think about them ex ante not just on the basis of revealed outcomes --><!-- ### countering objections: --><!-- - Time-consuming. Yes but in our experience we only pay this cost for failed studies. Fur successful studies, nearly all work that goes in to the pap pays off in terms of higher qualtity design, literal words we already wrote, and written-in-advance analysis code. --><!-- - Won't stop determined cheaters. Yes -- remember that the goal is not to prevent fraud, it's to help *researchers* improve their designs. Science depends on trust. --><!-- - Replication is better (@Coffman2015). These are complements, not substitutes. --><!-- - I can't preregister what I will do because I don't know what I will find. That's fine too, just write down how you will go about "finding" things so we (and YOU) can understand your own process. --><!-- ### Other thoughts --><!-- - when is the right moment to write a pap? --><!-- - relationship to registered reports? --><!-- - SOPs --><!-- ### citations on paps --><p><strong>Further reading</strong>.</p>

<p>Ethical review by institutional review boards (IRBs) is required in many countries, and in some additional review is required by entities governing health and other specific types of research. Social scientists are also increasingly focused on meeting ethical standards that go beyond the requirements of these national laws. Ethical appendices are required by some journals describing protections for human subjects and many funding agencies now require defenses of the ethics of a research study before funds are disbursed.</p>
<p>Common ethical principles include respect for persons, beneficence (researchers must have the welfare of participants in mind in designing the research), informed consent by participants, and minimizing harm to participants and others.
<!-- Several parts of a research design are implicated in these principles: the data strategy, which affects who is selected to participate (thus who is affected directly and also indirectly by the research), what treatments are given to them and to whom, and what measures are collected from them; the answer strategy, which determines what information about participants is shared with the broader public; and even the inquiry, which affects the value of the research to participants and society. --></p>
<p>Ethical considerations extend well beyond the elements that are captured by a design declaration. For instance a declaration of analytic relevant components of a design may tell you little about the level of care and respect accorded to subjects. Nevertheless we think it useful to identify when design relevant features can be informative for ethical judgments.</p>
<div id="ethical-principles-as-diagnosands" class="section level3">
<h3>
<span class="header-section-number">21.2.1</span> Ethical principles as diagnosands<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#ethical-principles-as-diagnosands"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h3>
<p>Researchers can use the declare-diagnose-redesign process to help inform some ethical judgments. In particular, a diagnostic-statistic could be defined for each relevant ethical criteria. For example, a design can be scored based on the total cost to participants, how many participants were harmed (i.e., how many were retraumatized by being asked out past experience with violence), the average level of informed consent measured by a survey about comprehension of the study goals, or the risks of adverse events.</p>
<p>Consider two examples.</p>
<p><strong>Costs.</strong> A common concern is that measurement imposes cost on subjects, if only by wasting their time. Subjects’ time is a valuable resource – they often donate willingly to the scientific enterprise by taking a survey or similar. Sometimes their generosity is repaid with financial compensation for their time. Sometimes subjects are unknowing participants in a research study because obtaining informed consent would so distort their behavior as to hinder the ability of the researchers to study it.</p>
<p><strong>Risks not just realizations.</strong> More subtly, different realizations of the data from the same data strategy may also differ in their ethical status. As a result, the ethics of the study cannot only be determined by looking at what in fact happened during the study — how many participants were there and how many were treated, how many were harmed, and how many raised complaints. Instead, the ethical status of the project depends on judgments about <em>potential</em> harms and <em>potential</em> participants: not only what did happen, but what could have happened.</p>
<!-- tara's paper relevant here -->
<p>When the design is diagnosed, then diagnosands can be constructed that summarize the level of ethical encumbrance across possible realizations of the design. The first way these ethical diagnosands can be used is to determine whether the study design meets a set of ethical thresholds. Is the probability of harm minimal enough? Is the average level of informed consent sufficient? Given that these characteristics vary across designs and across realizations of the same design, writing down concretely both what the measure of the ethical characteristic is and what the threshold is for the design to be ethical can help structure thinking. (These diagnoses and threshold determinations can also be shared in ethical writeups of the design.)</p>
<p>Among ethical designs, researchers must select a single design to implement. Often, once an ethical threshold is met, we select among feasible designs based on research design criteria such as statistical power and bias. Instead, we should continue to assess ethical considerations alongside the quality of the research design. Among ethical designs, there are still often tradeoffs between how much time is asked of subjects and the risk of harm. We should select the designs that weight these considerations (perhaps highly!) against the power of our designs. To do so, we can simply continue to include the diagnosands related to ethical criteria in our diagnoses and the redesign of studies.</p>
<p>A difficult challenge in this process is that in order to weigh ethical criteria against research design criteria such as power and cost, we must put be able to measure the two on a common scale. We must be able to think about the value to society of the research to weigh against the risks to participants and others. Similarly, we must be able to weigh more precise estimates of the same question against ethical considerations that also change based on the number of units and the proportion treated among other design features. By moving forward with research we must implicitly weigh these considerations. In IRB applications, we are often more directly asked to weigh the costs to subjects against the benefits of the research <em>to subjects</em> as well as to society as a whole.</p>
<!-- ### Illustration: Estimating expected costs and expected learning  -->
<!-- <!-- I would prefer to have an example where there is consent but people are willing to tkae part because they value the outcome -->
<!-- We illustrate how researchers can weigh the tradeoffs between the value of research and its ethical costs with an audit study of discrimination in government hiring. The characteristics of applicants to a municipal government job are randomized. The rate of callbacks for a job interview are compared across applicant characteristics. We consider three different inquiries that could be studied with the design: the hiring rate for job applications from a Black applicant and a White applicant; the hiring rate between someone from the local area vs. someone equally qualified who lives far away; and the rates between someone who went to East High School and someone who went to West High School in town. We judge the questions to rank in importance between high (the question of racial discrimination), medium (local favoratism), and low (personal interest). The value of the research is a function of the importance of the inquiry, but also how much we learn about it. We proxy for the learning from the experiment by sample size: the higher the $N$, the more we learn, but with decreasing marginal returns (it's a lot better to have a sample of 100 compared to 10; it matters less if it 1010 or 1100). Figure \@ref(fig:ethicsplot) shows the three research value curves labeled by the importance of the inquiry. -->
<!-- Because the job applicants are fictitious but appear real, a primary ethical concern in audit experiments is how much time hiring managers (the participants in the research) spend reviewing the fictitious applications. In the case of government hiring, it is public money spent on their review. The time cost to participants is linear in the number of applications: each application takes about ten minutes to review, regardless of how many are sent. We represent the cost to participants as the purple line in Figure \@ref(ethicsplot).  -->
<!-- We have placed the costs to participants on the same scale as the value of the research, by placing a value to society of the research and the value to society of the time of the hiring managers. When benefit exceeds cost (upper blue region), we decide to move forward with the research; if costs exceed benefits (lower gray region), we do not conduct the study. -->
<!-- The conclusion of the graph is that for high-importance inquiries, it is almost always worth doing the study. We get a lot of value from the research, despite the costs to participants. However, there is a region at low sample sizes where the cost to participants exceed the benefits from the research, because of the very imprecise answers we get from the research. We don't learn enough about the inquiry, despite its importance, to make it worth wasting the hiring managers time. By contrast, for low importance inquiries, it is never worth conducting the study. The costs to participants always exceed the (low) value of the research. Medium importance questions are in the middle: there is a region of the benefits curve (highlighted in blue) where it is worth doing the study, but two regions (highlighted in gray) where it is not worth it. The left region is where the sample is too small so the value of the research is low both because of its medium importance and we do not learn enough about it. The second gray region at right in the medium importance curve is where though we learn a lot about the inquiry, the cost is too high from the many hours of hiring manager time to justify what we learn because the inquiry is not important enough.  -->
<!-- In short, ethical determinations require diagnosis both of how much we learn and how much it costs to participants (along with other ethical costs), and we must place a value on both ethical costs and research benefits in order to compare them on the same scale.  -->

<p>Scholars are increasingly calling for reporting of ethical considerations in study design beyond IRB approval. By declaring your expectations about the ethical outcomes of an experiment in terms of diagnosands such as the time participants devote to the study and the probability of harm to individuals, a declared research design can be an input to ethical reporting. Readers can review how you considered ethical outcomes in your design and judge the mitigation efforts you undertook in relation to those expectations. Other scholars have proposed including ethical assessments in preanalysis plans. Declarations of ethical diagnosands are a natural complement to these preregistered assessments.</p>

<span class="header-section-number">21.3</span> Partners<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#partners"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h2>
<!-- make sure to rename the section title below -->
<p>Partnering with third-party organizations in research — cooperating to intervene in the world or to measure outcomes — is increasingly common in the social sciences. Researchers seek to to produce (and publish) scientific knowledge; they work with political parties, government agencies, non-profit organizations, and businesses to learn more than they could if they worked independently. These groups consent to working with researchers in order to learn about how to achieve their own organizational goals. For example, a government may want to learn how to expand access to healthcare or a corporation may want to learn how to improve its ad targeting.</p>
<p>In the best case scenario, the goals of the researchers and partner organizations are aligned. When the scientific question to be answered (the inquiry) is the same as the practical question the organization cares about, the gains from cooperation are clear. The research team gains access to the financial and logistical capacity of the organization to act in the world and the partner organization gains access to the scientific expertise of the researchers. Finding a good research partner almost always amounts to finding an organization with common – or at least not conflicting – goal. Understanding the private goals of the partner and of the researcher is essential to selecting a research design amenable to both parties. Research design declaration and diagnosis can help with this problem by formalizing tradeoffs between the two sets of goals.</p>
<p>One common divergence between partner and researcher goals is that partner organizations often do want to learn, but they care most about their primary mission. In business settings, this dynamic is sometimes referred to as the “learn versus earn” or “exploration-exploitation” tradeoff. An aid organization (and their donors) cares about delivering their program to as many people as possible; learning whether the program has the intended effects on the outcomes of interest is obviously also important, but resources spent on evaluation are resources <em>not</em> spent on program delivery.</p>
<p>Research design diagnosis can help navigate the learning-doing tradeoff. One instance of the tradeoff is that the proportion of units who receive a treatment (e.g., a medicine) represents the rate of “doing” and also affects the amount of learning in that in the extreme if all units are treated there can (typically) be no learning about the <em>effect</em> of the treatment. The tradeoff here is represented in a graph of the power of the study vs. the proportion treated (top facet), and the utility of the partner (bottom facet) which is increasing in the proportion treated. The researchers have a power cut-off at the standard 80% threshold. The partner also has a strict cut-off: they need to treat at least 2/3 of the sample in order to fulfill a donor requirement.</p>
<p>In the absence of partners, researchers might simply ignore the proportion treated axis and select the design with the highest power. With a partner organization, the researcher might use this graph in conversation with the partner to jointly select the design that has the highest power that has a sufficiently high proportion treated to meet the partner’s needs. This is represented in the “zone of agreement” in gray: in this region, the design has at least 80% power and at least 2/3 of the sample are treated. Deciding within this region involves a trade-off between power (which is decreasing in the proportion treated here) and the utility of the partner (which is increasing in proportion treated). The diagnosis surfaces the zone of the agreement and clarifies the choice between designs in the zone.</p>

</p>
</div>
<p>Choosing the proportion treated is one example of integrating partner constraints into research designs to generate feasible designs. A second common problem is that there are a set of units that <em>must</em> be treated, for ethical or political reasons (e.g., the home district of a government partner must receive the treatment), or that must not be treated. If these constraints are discovered after treatment assignment, they lead to noncompliance, which may substantially complicate analysis of the experiment and even prevent providing an answer to the original inquiry. Considerable thought has been given to avoiding this type of noncompliance. <span class="citation">Gerber and Green (<a href="references.html#ref-Gerber2012" role="doc-biblioref">2012</a>)</span> recommend, before randomizing treatment, exploring possible treatment assignments with the partner organization and using this exercise to elicit the set of units that must or cannot be treated. <span class="citation">King et al. (<a href="references.html#ref-king2007politically" role="doc-biblioref">2007</a>)</span> describe a “politically-robust” design, which uses pair-matched block randomization and when any unit is dropped due to political constraints the pair is dropped from the study.<a class="footnote-ref" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content="&lt;p&gt;Note the inquiry that can be answered from such a design is complex, reflecting effects for units in pairs that would not be dropped in either possible random assignment within the pair.&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>24</sup></a></p>
<p>Design diagnosis can help in these circumstances by providing a mechanism to specify possible patterns of noncompliance and diagnosing alternative designs to mitigate the negative consequences. In addition, they can be used to communicate with partners about the consequences of noncompliance for the research to help make better decisions together about how to avoid noncompliance once treatment is randomized and the research is in progress.</p>
<p>Our best advice for working with partners is to involve them in the design declaration and diagnosis process. How can we develop intuitions about the means, variances, and covariances of the important variables to be measured? Ask your partner for their best guesses, which may be far more educated than your own. For experimental studies, solicit your partner’s beliefs about the magnitude of the treatment effect on each outcome variable, subgroup by subgroup if possible. Be specific – ask what they think the average will be in the control group and what the average will be in the treatment group. Sorting out these beliefs very quickly sharpens the discussion of key design details. Share your design diagnoses and mock analyses <em>before</em> the study is launched in order to build consensus around the goals of the study.</p>
<p>Sometimes a partnership simply will not work out. Indeed most partnerships are never even initiated because researcher and organizational goals are too far apart. If you find yourself in a setting where partnership is doing too much violence to the research design, find a way to walk away from the project.</p>

A crucial person at the partner organization is the person who knows where the data are and how you can access them. Many people at partner organizations do not have this power, but you must be frequent touch.  -->

<!-- point 1 -->
<p>In any design, there will be a tradeoffs between diagnosands about the quality of the research as well as about its costs. Costs are a function both of the data strategy (some are more expensive than others!) and how the data are realized each time. Collecting original data is more expensive than analyzing existing data, but collecting new data may be more and less expensive depending on how easy it is to reach specific individuals to interview them. As a result, diagnosing research designs including cost diagnosands is important, and those diagnosands may usefully include both average cost and maximum cost. Researchers may make different decisions about cost: in some cases, the researcher will select the “best” design in terms of research design quality subject to a budget constraint, others will choose the cheapest among similar quality designs in order to save money for future research. Diagnosis can help identify each set and decide among them.</p>
<p>To relax the budget constraint, researchers apply for funding. Funding applicants wish to obtain as large a grant as possible for their design, but have difficulty credibly communicating the quality of their design given the subjectivity of the exercise. Funders, on the flip side, wish to get the most value for money in the set of proposals they decide to fund, and have difficulty assessing the quality of proposed research. MIDA and design declaration provide a tool for speaking in a common language that can be more easily verified by both sides about what design is being proposed and what its value is to knowledge under a set of assumptions that can be interrogated by funders.</p>
<p>Funding applications often aim to communicate what research design is being proposed; why learning answers from the design would be useful, important, or interesting to scholars, the public, policymakers, or another audience; how the research design provides credible answers to the question; that the researcher is capable of executing the design; and that there is value-for-money in the design and the answers it provides.</p>
<p>A new section of funding applications that would aid in communicating about each of these questions is declaring the MIDA of the design and presenting a diagnosis of the design. In addition to common diagnosands such as bias and efficiency, two special diagnosands may be valuable: cost and, related, value-for-money. Cost can be included for each design variant as a function of design features such as sample size, the number of treated units, and the duration of survey interviews. The cost may vary by these parameters and may vary across possible designs when, for example, the number of treated units is a random number. Simulating the design across possible realizations of the design, thus, provides a distribution of costs as a function of choices the researcher makes. Value for money is a diagnosand that is a function of cost and also the amount that is learned from the design. RMSE might be one value criterion, another would be the average difference between priors and posteriors under a Bayesian answer strategy (a direct measure of learning).</p>
<p>In some cases, funders request applicants to provide multiple options and multiple price points or to make clear how a design could be altered such that it could be funded at a lower (or higher) level. Redesigning a design with differing sample sizes would communicate how the researcher conceptualizes these options, but also provide the funder with an understanding of tradeoffs between the amount of learning and cost in these design variants. Applicants could use redesign to justify the high cost of their request and to ask for additional funding.</p>
<p>Ex ante power analyses, required by an increasing number of funders, illustrate the crux of the misaligned incentives between applicants and funders. A power analysis can demonstrate almost any design is “sufficiently powered” by changing expected effect sizes and noise. By clarifying the assumptions of the power analysis in code, researchers can more easily defend these choices. Funders can more easily interrogate these assumptions. Power analyses using standard power calculators online have difficult-to-interrogate assumptions built in and cannot accommodate the specifics of many common designs. As a result, many return incorrect estimates of power for these designs <span class="citation">(Blair et al. <a href="references.html#ref-bccmapsr" role="doc-biblioref">2020</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>Funders who request design declarations can compare funding applications on common scales: root mean-squared error, bias, and power. Of course, they also want to weigh considerations like the importance of the question and the fit with their funding program. But moving design considerations onto a common scale takes guesswork out of the process and reduces reliance on researcher claims about properties.</p>
<!-- -- funders often request power analysis, but these are typically described in words and thus the assumptions behind them cannot be interrogated fully. (a) not in code, so not specific; (b) user power calculators that are wrong (cite paper); (c) do not provide the details funders need to verify whether they agree with the assumptions.  -->
<!-- -- for funders, providing MIDA declared in code allows them to change the parameters of the design and test how the properties of the design change with beliefs about the world in M or data strategy parameters in D such as sample size, rather than having to rely on claims by applicants -->
<!-- -- often funders require regular reporting on changes in plan -- MIDA and design declaration provides a way to communicate (a) what those changes are and (b) how they change the values of diagnosands.  -->
<!-- -- value for money as a diagnosand (cost of each design as a function of design parameters) -->
<!-- -- allows funders to compare on a common scale (the same set of diagnosands) funding proposals -- often trying to evaluate "quality" but hard to do that with narrative proposals -->
