# What parameters should you vary to learn about designs 

<!-- - Hold inquiry constant!
- Compare performance of the design according to choices the researcher makes
    - D: Sample size, fraction randomly assigned, parameters of the randomized response, coding choices (e.g., binary vs. continuous, index vs. multiple, etc.)
    - A: Possible estimators, priors(???)
- And against the researcher's beliefs
    - M: ICC, null model, alternative DAGs, heterogeneity
- Conduct subject to constraints: budget, ethical, logistical
