<!-- - Standard diagnosands (paragraph on each of the diagnosands in our defaults)
- Ways of getting answers to a question wrong
- Diagnosing inferential statistics (SE bias vs. coverage, error rates for ps, Bayes?)
- How to select diagnosands (some sort of decision tree?)
- Multiple estimates / inquiries [JC]
- How to think about uncertainty about model parameters (multiple designs?)
- Diagnosands that are a function of "multiple designs" like MDE
- Conditional diagnosands different? -->
