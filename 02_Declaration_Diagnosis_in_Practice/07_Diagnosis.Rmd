## Diagnosing a single design

- Definition and practical details of Monte Carlo and diagnosands (and discussion of formulae) [JC]
- Graphic of simulations (of multiple runs)

## How do you select diagnosands?

- Diagnose given the purposes of the study
- Single shot vs repeated designs (MSE vs bias)
- Moral questions (Type 1 vs Type 2 errors)
- Power for biased designs
- Standard diagnosands (paragraph on each of the diagnosands in our defaults)
- Ways of getting answers to a question wrong
- Diagnosing inferential statistics (SE bias vs. coverage, error rates for ps, Bayes?)
- How to select diagnosands (some sort of decision tree?)
- Multiple estimates / inquiries [JC]
- How to think about uncertainty about model parameters (multiple designs?)
- Diagnosands that are a function of “multiple designs” like MDE
- Conditional diagnosands different?
- Uncertainty of diagnosands (bootstrapping etc.)

## Diagnosis to assess the robustness of designs to models [GB]

- Hold inquiry constant! (read Richard Crump “Moving the Goalposts”)
- Hold three constant, vary one of MIDA at a time
- M: ICC, null model, alternative DAGs, heterogeneity
- I:
