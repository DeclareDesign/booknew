## Classes of estimands 

A well defined research design usually requires a well defined question and the quality of a design can often be assessed in terms of how well the question can be answered. 

In all that follows we will make use of the concept of an *estimand*, which we take to be quantity that you seek to estimate, it is the correct answer to the question you are asking.

It's October in an election year. Your inquiry is: "how many voters will vote Democrat in November?" The true answer is 66,221,143. This true answer is your estimand, you seek to estimate this number now, even though the election has not happened yet. On the basis of a survey your best guess is 65, 112, 114. This is your estimate for this estimand.

In this case the estimand is a number and one that will eventually be revealed, letting you assess how well your estimate measures up against your estimand. But in social science inequiry estimands can take many different forms. 

We describe eight families of estimand. These different families  reflect different social scientific orientations and often different 

It turns out that many estimands can be thought of as summaries of potential outcomes. TO describe these we will imagine a  simple model, in which $Y$ is thought to depend on $X$ and $M$ and $M$ in turn is thought to depend on $X$. We represent this barebones model using a DAG in figure \@ref(XMYgraph).

```{r XMYgraph, echo = FALSE, fig.caption = "X affects Y directly as well as indirectly via M"}

plot(dagitty::graphLayout(dagitty("dag{ 
  X -> Y ;
  X -> M ;
  M -> Y
 }")))
```

ADD NUMBERS WITH POTENTIAL OUTCOMES

USE ONLY PO NOTATION

### Descriptive estimands

Descriptive estimands can also require inference, not simply measurement. 

Simplest case level estimand:

$$X = 1$$
"Yes"

An example of a descriptive estimand is:

$$E_{i\in N}(Y)$$

$$E_{i\in N}(Y | X=1)$$

This descriptive estimand is to be distinguished from the counterfactual estimand:


$$\Pr(Y=1 | X \leftarrow 1)$$

where $\leftarrow$ is interpreted to mean that $X$ is "set" to the indicated value. 

* Moments; covariance 

### Simple causal estimands

The simplest causal estimand is the outcome that a unit (or group) would have under a possibly counterfactual condition. The expected **potential outcome**:

$$\Pr(Y=1 | X \leftarrow 1)$$


The **average treatment effect** is a summary of such potential outcomes across two conditions.

$$\Pr(Y=1 | X \leftarrow 1) - \Pr(Y=1 | X \leftarrow 0)$$

Defined over a population *N*, the average treatment effect is written using potential outcomes notation as:

$$E_{i\in N}(Y(X=1) - Y(X=0))$$

These simple estimands might condition on observational quantities, giving rise to the **conditional average treatment effect**:

$$\Pr(Y=1 | X \leftarrow 1, M = 1) - \Pr(Y=1 | X \leftarrow 0, M = 1)$$

or, perhaps,  **controlled conditional average treatment effects**:

$$\Pr(Y=1 | X \leftarrow 1, M \leftarrow 1) - \Pr(Y=1 | X \leftarrow 0, M \leftarrow 1)$$

or, perhaps *differences* in effects:


**Causes of effects** estimand:


### Local estimands / EStiamnds over latent classes, principal strata

Complier average is also a CATE
RDD is also a CATE
Estimands as summaries

### Study dependent estimands
Expected ATT vs realized ATT

### Complex counterfactuals


### Parametric estimands

Dimensionality reduction
Model parameters

### Vector-valued inquiries (set of predictions for N units), 

The diagnostic statistic is ith respect to the vector

e.g. the CEF

QCA estimand.

### Models as estimands



## Selecting estimands

### You are responsible for your estimand

### Estimands to purpose. Choice of inquiry is not valueless


### Estimand scope:What is the set of units which you want to learn the answer about? Know what ATE averages over

Implication of estimand definition for analysis

### Unknown estimands: Inquiries for discovery



## Auxilliary Inquiries

- these inquiries are not the main substantive focus of the design, but they are features of the model that have observable implications and can be checked. 

- For models that include mediating roles for a variable, need to demonstrate that Z affects M at a minimum.

- Balance tables demonstrate a required assumption that Z is orthogonal to pre-treatment characteristics

- A full DAG specification can enumerate the full set of conditional independencies that are implied by the model; these can be checked and verified.
