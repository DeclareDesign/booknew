<!-- make sure to rename the section title below -->
<p>Partnering with third-party organizations in research — cooperating to intervene in the world or to measure outcomes — is increasingly common in the social sciences. Researchers seek to to produce (and publish) scientific knowledge; they work with political parties, government agencies, non-profit organizations, and businesses to learn more than they could if they worked independently. These groups consent to working with researchers in order to learn about how to achieve their own organizational goals. For example, a government may want to learn how to expand access to healthcare or a corporation may want to learn how to improve its ad targeting.</p>
<p>In the best case scenario, the goals of the researchers and partner organizations are aligned. When the scientific question to be answered (the inquiry) is the same as the practical question the organization cares about, the gains from cooperation are clear. The research team gains access to the financial and logistical capacity of the organization to act in the world and the partner organziation gains access to the scientific expertise of the researchers. Finding a good research partner almost always amounts to finding an organization with common – or at least not conflicting – goal. Understanding the private goals of the partner and of the researcher is essential to selecting a research design amenable to both parties. Research design declaration and diagnosis can help with this problem by formalizing tradeoffs between the two sets of goals.</p>
<p>One common divergence between partner and researcher goals is that partner organizations often do want to learn, but they care most about their primary mission. In business settings, this dynamic is sometimes referred to as the “learn versus earn” or “exploration-exploitation” tradeoff. An aid organization (and their donors) cares about delivering their programme to as many people as possible; learning whether the programme has the intended effects on the outcomes of interest is obviously also important, but resources spent on evaluation are resources <em>not</em> spent on programme delivery.</p>
<p>Research design diagnosis can help navigate the learning-doing tradeoff. One instance of the tradeoff is that the proportion of units who receive a treatment (e.g., a medicine) represents the rate of “doing” and also affects the amount of learning in that in the extreme if all units are treated there can (typically) be no learning about the <em>effect</em> of the treatment. The tradeoff here is represented in a graph of the power of the study vs. the proportion treated (top facet), and the utility of the partner (bottom facet) which is increasing in the proportion treated. The researchers have a power cut-off at the standard 80% threshold. The partner also has a strict cut-off: they need to treat at least 2/3 of the sample in order to fulfill a donor requirement.</p>
<p>In the absence of partners, researchers might simply ignore the proportion treated axis and select the design with the highest power. With a partner organization, the researcher might use this graph in conversation with the partner to jointly select the design that has the highest power that has a sufficiently high proportion treated to meet the partner’s needs. This is represented in the “zone of agreement” in gray: in this region, the design has at least 80% power and at least 2/3 of the sample are treated. Deciding within this region involves a trade-off between power (which is decreasing in the proportion treated here) and the utility of the partner (which is increasing in proportion treated). The diagnosis surfaces the zone of the agreement and clarifies the choice between designs in the zone.</p>
<div class="inline-figure"><img src="book_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-481-1.png" width="100%"></div>
<p>Choosing the proportion treated is one example of integrating partner constraints into research designs to generate feasible designs. A second common problem is that there are a set of units that <em>must</em> be treated, for ethical or political reasons (e.g., the home district of a government partner must receive the treatment), or that must not be treated. If these constraints are discovered after treatment assignment, they lead to noncompliance, which may substantially complicate analysis of the experiment and even prevent providing an answer to the original inquiry. Considerable thought has been given to avoiding this type of noncompliance. Gerber and Green recommend, before randomizing treatment, exploring possible treatment assignments with the partner organization and using this exercise to elicit the set of units that must or cannot be treated. King et al. (cite) describe a ``politically-robust’’ design, which uses pair-matched block randomization and when any unit is dropped due to political constraints the pair is dropped from the study<a class="footnote-ref" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content="&lt;p&gt;Note the inquiry that can be answered from such a design is complex, reflecting effects for units in pairs that would not be dropped in either possible random assignment within the pair.&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>24</sup></a></p>
<p>Design diagnosis can help in these circumstances by providing a mechanism to specify possible patterns of noncompliance and diagnosing alternative designs to mitigate the negative consequences. In addition, they can be used to communicate with partners about the consequences of noncompliance for the research to help make better decisions together about how to avoid noncompliance once treatment is randomized and the research is in progress.</p>
<p>Our best advice for working with partners is to involve them in the design declaration and diagnosis process. How can we develop intuitions about the means, variances, and covariances of the important variables to be measured? Ask your partner for their best guesses, which may be far more educated than your own. For experimental studies, solicit your partner’s beliefs about the magnitude of the treatment effect on each outcome variable, subgroup by subgroup if possible. Be specific – ask what they think the average will be in the control group and what the average will be in the treatment group. Sorting out these beliefs very quickly sharpens the discussion of key design details. Share your design diagnoses and mock analyses  the study is launched in order to build consensus around the goals of the study.</p>
<p>Sometimes a partnership simply will not work out. Indeed most partnerships are never even initiated because researcher and organizational goals are too far apart. If you find yourself in a setting where partnership is doing too much violence to the research design, find a way to walk away from the project.</p>
<!-- ### Scattered thoughts -->
<!-- - Partnerships and ethics should be in here -->
<!-- - Research for Impact (@levine_2020) -->
<!-- - When to walk away -->
<!-- - Advice: there's usually a boss that gives you the green light, then staff people who actually help you. Our advice is to ensure that at least some meetings are with both the boss and the staff people so that the staff people know that the boss cares about the project and are therefore motivated to help you. A crucial person at the partner organization is the person who knows where the data are and how you can access them. Many people at partner organizations do not have this power, but you must be frequent touch.  -->
<!-- - In some cases, some member of the research staff can actually embed wiht the partner organization to ensure all the good things. -->
<!-- - Involve partners in PAP writing. -->
<!-- - when should partners be coauthors on the paper? -->
