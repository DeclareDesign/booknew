Any research design -- whether the research question is fundamentally causal or descriptive -- implicitly relies on a causal model of the world. These models include beliefs about what variables are important and how they interrelate. Even if the model is hazy, researchers carry with them a model of the world that could in principle be expressed as a probablistic causal model. As described in the previous chapter, probabalistic causal models are described by a set of exogeneous and endogenous variables, a set of functional relationships between the variables, and a probability distribution over the exogenous variables.

Critically, whether a design is good or bad depends on the model. A data and analysis strategy might fare very well under one model of the world but poorly under another. Thus to get to the point where we can assess a design we need to make explicit the design-relevant features of the implicit causal models in our heads. This chapter is about how to go about this difficult task.

We'll make use of two different formal languages for describing causal models: DAGs and potential outcomes. 

The potential outcomes formalization emphasizes a counterfactual notion of causality. $Y_i(Z = 0)$ is the outcome for unit $i$ that *would* occur *were* the causal variable equal to zero and $Y_i(Z = 1)$ is the outcome that would occure if $Z$ were set to one. The difference between them defines the effect of the treatment on the outcome for unit $i$. Since at most only one potential outcome can ever be revealed, at least one of the two potential outcomes is necessarily counterfactual. Usually, the potential outcomes notation $Y_i(Z)$ reports how outcomes depend on one feature -- $Z$, ignoring all other determinants of outcomes.  This is not to say that these don't matter, they do, they are just not the focus. In a sense they are contained in the subscript $i$ since the units carry with them all relevant features  other than $Z$. We can, and will generalize to settings where we want to focus on more than one cause, in which case we use expressions of the form $Y(0,0)$ or $Y(0,1)$.

The graphical model formulation approach makes use of DAGs or "directed acyclic graphs" to characterize causal relations. Each node on a graph is a variable and the edges that connect them represent possible causal effects. An arrow from a "parent" node to a "child" node indicates that the value of the parent sometimes determines the outcome of the child; more formally: the parent's value is an argument in a functional equation determining the child's outcome. Though consistent with a counterfactual notion of causality, DAGs emphasize mechanistic accounts: when the exposure variable changes, the outcome variable changes as a result---though possibly in different ways for different units. DAGs are *nonparametric*. This means that they do not encode all the beliefs about the full causal model. They don't show *how* variables are related, just *that* they are related.

Despite what you may have inferred from the sometimes heated disagreements between scholars who prefer one formalization to the other, DAGs and potential outcomes are compatible systems for thinking about causality. We *could* use only the language of causal graphs or we *could* use only the language of potential outcomes. We choose to use both languages because they are useful for expressing different facets of research design. We use DAGs to describe the web of causal interrelations in a concise way (writing out the potential outcomes for every relationship in the model is tedious). We use potential outcomes when we want to zoom in on *particular* causal relationships and to make fine distinctions between inquiries that apply to different sets of units (it's difficult to describe effect heterogeneity with graphical models).

## Defining the population of units for our model

The first choice to make in declaring $M$ is the set of units about which you wish to make inferences.  This is largely determined by your inquiry ($I$). We might usefully distinguish between three types of sets of units---all of which we will refer to as your "population." 

* Finite population. If your inquiry is about the population of Americans or Brazilians, your model should describe the characteristics of all Americans or Brazilians. You might only analyze data from a sample of these, but you seek nevertheless to make inferences about this (finite) population.

* Finite sample. Moving down, your inquiry might only be about a sample from a finite population. If you are interested in the sample average treatment effect, then you need only  describe only the units in your sample. For practical purposes your sample then *is* your population. Subtly however, if you are interested in a sample but do not know what your sample from the population will be then your inquiry might concern a typical sample from a population in some way and you will need to your estimand.   

* Superpopulation. Moving *up* you might imagine units as being draws from an infinite population. You are interested in "what happens when you shake a fizzy drink?": the set of instances is infinite and when you characterize the superpopulation you want to describe a distribution over possible cases not a finite set of cases.

Later you will see that the interpretation of population steps in a model can depend on which of these types of population you care about.

## What variables belong in the causal model?

When considering what variables to include in a model researchers are often torn between two conflicting goals. First, we want to learn more and more about how the world works or in other words, to fill in more and more of a large causal model. There are an infinite number of nodes and edges in this model --- from how people vote to how they save and spend money to how they find romantic partners, all of which are interrelated. Second, we generally seek simple explanations where possible. Indeed in some accounts the point of research is to generate simplified representations of the world. The analogy of a map is often used: a useful map usually should have less detail than the object it is mapping. 

These considerations vie with  each other when considering which variables "of interest" to include in a model. For instance, which are the causes to examine when explaining an outcome. But additional arguments speak to the need to include variables that are not of primary interest but which are needed in order to understand relations between those that are. This is the case for "control variables" or "instrumental" variables. 

In the design declaration framework the variables that we need to specify in $M$ are in general those we will need in the latter three elements in our research design: our inquiry $I$, data strategy $D$, and answer strategy $A$.

$I$: In order to reason about whether the data we collect will be able to provide an answer to our inquiry, we need to define all of the variables used to construct our inquiry. In descriptive research, this will mean the variables we will summarize. In causal research, this will mean the potential outcomes under different states of the world, such as treatment and control. For example, if we are studying the effects of a voter mobilization campaign on vote choice between the three candidates running in a primary election, we should define a vote choice variable and the values it takes on in two circumstances: in the presence of the voter mobilization campaign (treatment) and without it (control).

$D$: The data strategy --- sampling, treatment assignment, and measurement --- defines many of the variables we need to specify in the model. Sampling procedures often involve stratification (e.g., sampling equal proportions of men and women), clustering (e.g., sampling all of the individuals in a household to participate in the research), or both. In the model, we need to define the variables that will be used to stratify and cluster. Similarly, treatment assignment can involve assigning treatments within blocks and cluster assignment where all units are assigned to the same status. The variables that are used to construct blocks and that will form clusters will be defined in the model. Finally, all of the variables that will be measured should also be defined in the model. When we measure latent variables imperfectly, for example sensitive questions where a true characteristic exists but respondent do not always admit it, we should define both the latent trait and measured responses.

$A$: Finally, answer strategies rely on collected data to provide an answer to the inquiry, and so any variable in the collected data should be defined in the model. (Any of these variables should also be defined in the measurement strategy.) Beyond outcomes and treatment variables, we may need variables to define clusters used in clustered standard errors, to construct weights for poststratification of estimates to match population characteristics, and to visualize our data.

In addition to defining these variables, we need to know how they relate to each other. We define a set of nonparametric structural causal relationships. With these variables at hand, we can define a nonparametric structural causal model and visualize the model using a directed acyclic graph.

We illustrate using a DAG to describe a model with an abstract research design in which we will collect information about $N$ units. We will measure a pretreatment covariate $X$, assign a treatment at random $Z$, and collect a posttreatment outcome $Y$. We know there are other determinants of the outcome beyond $Z$ and $X$, but we don't need to write down our beliefs about them because our main inquiry is the average treatment effect of $Z$ on $Y$. All we'll say about those other deteriminants is that they are causally related to both $X$ and $Y$, but not to $Z$, since $Z$ will be randomly assigned by us. Following the rule that we only need to make explicit the parts of our causal model that are required for the inquiry, data strategy, and answer strategy, this bare specification is sufficient.

The nonparametric structure causal model can be written like this:

\begin{align*}
X &= f_X(U)\\
Y &= f_Y(Z, X, U)
\end{align*}

This DAG encodes this model in graphical form:

```{r p2simpledag, echo = FALSE, fig.cap = "Simple DAG."}
a_blue <- "#0072B2"
a_gray <- "grey80"

dag <-
  dagify(Y ~ X + Z + U,
         X ~ U,
         latent = "U")

gg_df <-
  tidy_dagitty(dag,
               layout = "manual",
               x = c(1, 0, -1, 1),
               y = c(1, 1, 0, 0))

gg_df <-
  gg_df %>%
  mutate(
    color = case_when(
      name == "U" ~ a_gray,
      name == "X" ~ a_blue,
      name == "Y" ~ a_blue,
      name == "Z" ~ a_blue
    )
  )


g <-
ggplot(gg_df, aes(x = x, y = y, xend = xend, yend = yend)) +
  geom_dag_node(aes(color = color)) +
  scale_color_identity() +
  geom_dag_text(color = "black", family = "Helvetica") +
  geom_dag_edges() +
  theme_dag()

g
```

Possibly the most important thing that a DAG can teach us is which research questions are even answerable in a given setting by applying the "back-door criterion," which asks whether a back-door path exists between a pair of causally-related variables. Here, the causal relationship between $X$ and $Y$ is confounded by the back-door path $X <- U -> Z$. (for much more on the back-door criterion, see XXX). Since we have no information about what is in $U$, we can't learn about the effects of $X$ on $Y$. However, the treatment variable $Z$ has no edges leading in to it, which represents the idea that $Z$ is randomly assigned. There are no back door paths leading from $Z$ to $Y$, so we *can* learn about average causal effects of Z on Y. We could also draw descriptive inferences about the distributions of the observed variables like their ranges and averages or their variances and covariances.


## Some terminology: A classification of variable types

Sometimes researchers use distinct names for different nodes depending on what role they are playing in a model. We will often refer to nodes in this way using the following terms:

* Outcome variables:  
* Explanatory variables
* Conditioning or moderating variables
* Mediating variables
* Confounding variables
* Instrumental variables

## What do we need to specify about these variables?

DAGs convey beliefs about whether *whether* two variables are causally related, but they do not encode beliefs about *how* they are related. This is no criticism of DAGs --- they just don't encode all of our causal beliefs about a system. However, in order to assess many properties of a research design we need to go further. We need to specify the scales and probability distribution of exogenous variables and the functional forms of the endogenous variables (how they relate to parent variables). This will include incorporating beliefs about effect sizes, but also correlations between variables, intra-class correlations (ICCs), and interactions. All of this to say: in order to declare and diagnose our designs, we'll need to make the leap from nonparametric models to *parametric* structural causal models. This move is not without costs -- each specific choice we make over and above the nonparametric model is an opportunity to be more wrong about the world!

Suppose that according to our model, the effect of treatment should be larger for units with $X = 1$. We can encode this belief in a design declaration. In the `declare_population` function, we write that $U$ is normally distributed with mean 0 and standard devation 1; $X$ follows a bernoulli distribution but units have a probability of $X$ equalling one that depends on $U$ in a particular way. In the `declare_potential_outcomes` function, we describes how the average effect of treatment is 0.5 when $X = 0$ but 0.5 + 0.5 = 1 when $X = 1$.

```{r}
diff_in_cates <- 0.5
design <-
  declare_population(N = 100,
                     U = rnorm(N),
                     X = rbinom(N, 1, prob = pnorm(0.5 * U + rnorm(N)))) +
  declare_potential_outcomes(Y ~ 0.5 * X +
                               0.5 * Z +
                               diff_in_cates * X * Z +
                               0.5 * U)
```

We could incorporate different beliefs about the causal model by changing the `diff_in_cates` parameter. However, notice that regardless of the value of the interaction (either zero or some other number), the DAG looks the same. So if you want to design your study for the difference-in-CATEs, then you'll need to go beyond the DAG to write down your beliefs about the extent of heterogeneity using another tool -- design declaration complements DAGs in this specific way.

<!-- - some of these variables will be exogenous and endogenous, in Pearl's terms. by exogenous variables, he means variables without parents, no antecendent causes. by endogenous variables, he means those with parents, that are determined in part by earlier variables. endogenous variables are distinct from the problem of endogeneity, which comes from a single variable being a parent of both the treatment variable of interest and the outcome we wish to measure the causal effect of the treatment on. we will use it in Pearl's sense. -->


## How do we make educated guesses to fill in the model?

The content of models typically comes from two places: reading the past literature and qualitative research. Past theoretical work can guide the set of nodes that are relevant and how they are connected by edges. Past empirical work can provide further insight on the set of edges that exist (or do not). However, when past research is thin on a topic, there is no substitute for insights gained through qualitative data collection: focus groups and interviews with key informants who know aspects of the model that are hidden to the researcher; archival investigations to understand how to draw understand a causal process when the actors in it are no longer alive, or to gain insights only contained in administrative records; and immersive participant observation to see with your eyes how social actors behave. Fenno (1982) calls this "soaking and poking." This mode of inquiry, discovery, is separate from the qualitative research designs that provide an answer to an inquiry deductively. We examine those throughout the book (particular examples are in library entry XX and YY). Instead, qualitative insights such as this, which Lieberman (2005) labels "model-building" case studies, do not aim to answer a question but rather yield a new theoretical model. Quantitative research is often seen as distinct from qualitative research, but the model building phase in both is itself qualitative.

Identifying nodes and edges important to constructing $I$, $D$, and $A$ (and thus including in $M$) typically come from two sources: reading past literature and conducting new qualitative research. Past theoretical work can guide the choice of nodes that are relevant and how they are connected by edges. Past empirical work can provide further insight on the set of edges that exist (or do not). However, when past research is thin on a topic, there is no substitute for insights gained through qualitative data collection: focus groups and interviews with key informants who know aspects of the model that are hidden to the researcher; archival investigations to understand how to draw understand a causal process when the actors in it are no longer alive, or to gain insights only contained in administrative records; and immersive participant observation to see with your eyes how social actors behave. Fenno (1982) calls this "soaking and poking." This mode of inquiry, discovery, is separate from the qualitative research designs that provide an answer to an inquiry deductively. We examine those throughout the book (particular examples are in library entry XX and YY). Instead, qualitative insights such as this, which Lieberman (2005) labels "model-building" case studies, do not aim to answer a question but rather yield a new theoretical model. Quantitative research is often seen as distinct from qualitative research, but the model building phase in both is itself qualitative.

The next step --- selecting statistical distributions and their parameters to describe exogenous variables and the functional forms of endogenous variables --- is often more uncomfortable. We do not know the magnitude of the effect of an intervention before we do the research or the correlation between two outcomes when those are the goal of the research. That's why we are conducting the study! However, we are not fully in the dark in most cases and can make educated guesses about parameters like effect sizes, intraclass correlations, and correlations between variables.

We can conduct meta-analyses of past, relevant studies on the same topic to identify the range of plausible effect sizes, intraclass correlations, correlations between variables, and other model parameters. Conduct such a meta-analysis might be as simple as collecting the three papers that measured similar outcomes in the past and calculating the average intraclass correlation and its range across the three. A more sophisticated but still straightforward analysis would be to calculate the precision-weighted average of effect sizes and use that as the baseline effect size in the model, but also calculate the predictive interval from a random effects meta-analysis to characterize the expected range of effect sizes across differing contexts.

The key question in conduct such a meta-analysis is how to select studies that are "relevant." There are four dimensions on which we might want to compare past studies to the current setting: similarity in the type of units, treatments, outcomes, and contexts [@cronbach1982]. Except in the case of pure replication studies, we are typically studying a (possibly new) treatment in a new setting, with new participants, or with new outcomes, so there will not be perfect overlap. However, the variation in effects across contexts and these other dimensions will help structure the range of our guesses specified in the model.

When there are past studies that are especially close to our own, we may want to not define probability distributions that approximate the causal model of the world, but use the data from that past study directly as a stand in. To do so, instead of declaring variables and their distributions and potential outcomes, we can resample from the past data to obtain simulated alternative possible worlds.

Where there are no past studies that are sufficiently similar in some dimension, we can collect new data through pilot studies. We discuss risks to relying on data from small pilot studies in planning new research in Chapter \@ref(p4piloting). In short, we should not rely on effect size estimates from small pilot studies, and only use parameters such as the range of outcome data and the standard errors of estimates which are less noisy in declaring our new design.

In some cases, we can define many of the variables from early data collection in a study, e.g., from a baseline survey. Once we conduct a baseline survey, we can use the set of individuals selected for the study and their baseline characteristics to define many of the variables in our model. We can define our expectations about effect sizes and other features of endogenous variables, but rely on the correlations between exogenous variables from the baseline data. The danger here is that if we fix the characteristics of our model using baseline data, we will not consider what data *could have* been revealed if our sampling procedure had yielded a different set of study participants or we had conducted data collection a month later.

## Robustness to multiple models

The most uncomfortable part of declaring $M$ is choosing point estimates of its parameters such as the effect size, the mean and variance of the normal distribution that describes unknown heterogeneity. There is no need to specify a single point! Indeed, our fundamental uncertainty about the model should usually lead us to a range or even empirical distribution from past studies of each parameter.

We suggest three strategies for choosing these ranges: the *logical bounds* of a parameter, such as choosing the range of possible effect sizes based on the largest change from the bottom of a scale to the top of a scale; the *empirical distribution* from past studies, either the full range of the parameter or the predictive interval from a random effects meta-analysis; or a *best case*-*worst case* bounds, based on the substantive interpretation of results in light of past results, for example ranging from an effect size of zero to the largest plausible effect size. A design that performs well in terms of power and bias under one or all of these three ranges for each parameter can be labeled "robust to multiple models."

A separate goal is assessing the performance of a research design under different models implied by alternative theories. A good design will provide probative evidence about which model is correct regardless of which model it is that aligns with the true causal model of the world.

An important example is assessing the performance of a research design under a "null model" where the true effect size is zero. A good research design should report with high probability that there is insufficient evidence to reject a null effect. That same research design, under an alternative model with a large effect size, should with high probability return evidence rejecting the null hypothesis of zero effect. The example makes clear that in order to understand whether the research design is strong, we need to understand how it performs under not just multiple models, but the models implied by alternative theoretical understandings of the world.

Two alternative theories of why X causes Y, through mediator M1 or mediator M2 (and not both), imply two different structural causal models. When the inquiry is which variable mediates the relationship, we need to understand how the research design performs in providing evidence for which is correct under both possibilities.

## Fundamental uncertainty

Models are *models* -- they are abstractions and they are not the truth! The true causal structure of the world $W$ generates draws from the world $w$. The inquiry $I$ might not even defined under $W$, that is $I(w)$ might be $NA$. Applying the data strategy $D$ to $w$ might produce unexpected results. That is $D(w)$ need not be anything like $D(m)$. This disjuncture is unavoidable and is in large part, the whole point of doing research in the first place. We do not know $W$ -- that would require omniscience. We have learned parts of $W$ and put them in $M$ -- that's science. When research produces unexpected results, it's an indication that something in MIDA is out of whack and it is an opportunity for learning. The *next* research project will amend MIDA in order to bring $M$ closer to $W$.
