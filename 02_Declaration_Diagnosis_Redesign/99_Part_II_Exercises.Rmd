<!-- 1. Imagine you are a reviewer on a paper that claims smoking causes a smoking addiction. The data offered in support of this claim shows that all 100 subjects who smoke are addicted to smoking and that all 100 subject who do not smoke are not addicted.   -->

<!-- |                | is not addicted to smoking | is addicted to smoking | -->

<!-- a. Do the data support the conclusion that smoking causes addiction to smoking? -->
<!-- b. Now imagine you are a reviewer on a paper that claims sailing causes a sailing addiction. The data offered in support of this claim shows that all 100 subjects who sail are addicted to sailing and that all 100 subject who do not sail are not addicted. Do the data support the conclusion that sailing causes addiction to sailing? -->

<!-- c. How do your answers to (a) and (b) differ? Sketch (either in words or with a DAG) the alternative causal models for smoking and sailing that could have produced the two datasets. -->

<!-- d. Propose a data and answer strategy that would distinguish between the two causal models you described in (c). -->


<!-- 2. The Complier Average Causal Effect (CACE) is defined as the average effect of treatment on a subset of subjects who "comply" with their treatment assignment, i.e., if assigned to treatment, they take treatment but if assigned to control, they do not take treatment. The Average Treatment Effect on the Treated (ATT) is defined as the average effect of the treatment on those subjects who *were* treated. These two estimands are subtlety different. Declare a design and `draw_estimands` from it to demonstrate that these two estimands can be different. Hint: the ATT depends on the data strategy but the CACE does not. -->


<!-- 3. Give abstract, what can you tell me about MIDA -->

<!-- 4. Give a passage from one paper that is a quote of another paper, what's MIDA. Then look up the paper and say what was missed. Did the quoted passage correctly characterize the design? -->
