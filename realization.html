<p>Your design declaration is a road map for implementing your study. The data strategy tells you the procedure to use to sample units; how to assign treatments; and which variables to measure. Your answer strategy is the function that translates the realized data into a set of answers to your inquiries and statistics that communicate your confidence in those answers. If you have specified the data and answer strategies in sufficient detail in code, you can directly run the functions you declared to sample units and assign them to treatment and to analyze your data.</p>
<p>The road map is useful as a tool to learn where to go when things go right, but also to identify when you take a wrong turn and need to make decisions about how to get to an answer. In this sense, a design declaration should be a living document, updated to reflect the set of decisions you make along the way through the twists and turns of the research road. With the model of the world and an inquiry about it declared, when you are unable to collect a variable, treat a subset of units with treatment, or to reach some units for follow-up surveys, you can compare alternative ways of handling this deviation from your original plan on the same terms as you originally designed the experiment. These are all changes in your data strategy <span class="math inline">\(D\)</span>. You can assess options and also guide your decision-making about whether to continue your study at all or use the money for another better purpose. You can also use the comparison of diagnosands under alternative options as a tool to communicate with your research partners about why a change to their practices is needed. You can also use it to defend your intermediate data strategy choices when you are finished to reviewers and readers.</p>
<p>As you make changes to <span class="math inline">\(D\)</span>, changes in <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> may also be required in order to follow the principle of analyzing as you sample, assign treatment, and measure. When you switch from an individual randomization to a cluster randomization because it is not logistically possible to individually assign units to treatment, you will typically want to adjust your answer strategy to account for clustering in the calculation of standard errors. By keeping both your data strategy and your answer strategy up to date as you implement your study, you may also identify new data that must be collected or new steps to take in order to still be able to provide credible answers.</p>
<p>You also learn more about your design as you go along, not because anything goes wrong but as a natural progression of the research. For example, you may not know how many units there are per cluster or per block, key details in assigning treatments and analyzing data from experiments. When you learn these details, change your data and answer strategies to reflect these new details — and diagnose the new design to be sure you still agree with your original choices. Beyond the data and answer strategies, you may also learn about new nodes or edges in the model during the course of research. When you learn about new confounders or mediators, update your model, but also consider whether changes to your data and answer strategy are necessitated to ensure you can answer your original inquiry.</p>
<p>In short, your design declaration is a living document that you can keep updated and use as a tool to guide you along the research path, not just as a document to write at the beginning of the study and revisit when you are writing up. This advice is in apparent tension with the idea of preanalysis plans, in which you precommit to your analysis choices before data is collected. It need not be. It is useful to keep your original design declaration and to preregister it, but it is also useful to keep the declaration updated as you make the changes along the way that inevitably happen. You will be in a better position to make good choices when things go awry, and also to communicate when and why you made changes to your design.</p>
<!-- outline: -->
<!-- -- use your MIDA to figure out how to implement -->
<!-- -- redesign as you go when you haven't gotten specific enough -->
<!-- -- consider the whole design -- ex ante declared, then changed -- and what *could have happened*, which may be known to you ex ante (there could or could not be attrition) or unknown (you learn during implementation that there are some kinds of units that won't comply, so you need to think not just about which ones did or did not comply but which ones *could* have). the whole process is a function of your interventions in the world (treatment or measurement), so write down the whole process and potential outcomes to understand what you can and cannot learn. -->
<!-- -- use your MIDA to help you *make* logistical choices, help it prevent you from making bad decisions and use as tool to communicate with partners and implementers about why you do or do not wnat to make different changes (or BETTER evaluate tradeoffs in those decisions) -->
<!-- idea bin: -->
<!-- -- MIDA is a roadmap for how to implement the study -->
<!-- -- when there is a part not specified, redesign to specify and diagnose again -->
<!-- -- lots of choices you make after you start, because it was not clear what decisions would have to be made ex ante: how to make these choices? (redesign and diagnose!).  -->
<!-- -- often randomization procedure will have to take into account specifities of the number of units (odd numbers), blocks with differing numbers of units, cluster of varying sizes, etc. that require revising D -->
<!-- -- unexpected constraints come in that affect D, and may require changes to D but also A. redesign. -->
<!-- -- how to make decisions about unexpected changes when things going wrong? (even if you don't have a PAP). often want to create multiple variants of the design incorporating what went wrong. common example: unexpected noncompliance or unexpectedly high rates of attrition. may want to change analysis plan, and register it, so can use redesign to develop that new plan. but also may discover diagnosands are not good enough, so may want to change data strategy midstream to mitigate these problems. -->
<!-- -- what to do when you run out of money or feasibility of sample size or other aspects of D becomes clear. redesign mountain subject to new cost constraints. -->
<!-- -- make go-no go decisions about whether to continue -->
<!-- -- how to know if your inquiry is no longer answerable -->
<!-- -- updating your PAP -->
<!-- -- assessing what you can learn based on the implementation challenges: these are potential outcomes, i.e. could be affected by treatment, so are often informative about what we can learn about the original research question -->
<!-- -- often need to convince partners to not change plans -- MIDA can be a tool for helping assess tradeoffs in learning and doing -->
<!-- -- Projects that succeed have direct researcher invovlement. Outsourcing too much of the design can lead to big troubles. -->

<p>When something goes wrong or you learn things work differently than you expect, you need to pivot. You face two decisions: go/no-go, and if go, should you alter your research design to account for the new reality?</p>
<!-- -- Alex's example -->
<!-- -- Nollywood -->
<p>We faced another kind of noncompliance problem in a study in Nigeria: failure to deliver the correct treatment. We launched a cluster-randomized placebo-controlled factorial trial of a film treatment and an text message blast treatment. After a baseline study in 200 rural and urban communities randomly sampled from a list of all communities covered by our cell phone company partner for the text message treatment, we launched a 2x2 factorial cluster-randomized trial. We tested distributing the treatment film that encouraged reporting corruption in half of communities and a placebo version with the same content but for the reporting corruption. We crossed this with sending a treatment message to half of communities and a placebo message to the other half. In addition, we had a 40-community pure control group with no treatments to assess whether there was an effect of the placebo condition. A few days after the treatment began to be delivered, it became clear that the number of replies were extremely similar in treatment and placebo communities, counter to our expectation. Though our hypotheses might have been wrong, this led us to investigate whether the right treatment was being delivered. It was not. Our research partner, the cell phone company, had delivered the treatment message to all communities, so communities assigned to placebo received the wrong treatment. By the time the partner admitted the mistake, some activities — distributing the film or sending the SMS blast — had already taken place in 106 communities or about half the sample. We faced the two pivot decisions: abandon the study, or continue; and if we continued, what research design to adopt. We quickly agreed that we could not continue research in the 106 communities, because they had received at least partial treatment. We were left with 109 from our original sample of 200 plus 15 alternates that were selected in the same random sampling process in case there were problems in the 200 that necessitated replacing a community.</p>
<p>We could not switch regions in Nigeria, because we produced a feature-length film in the specific region where the study took place and the text message treatment was tied to the film. Moreover, we had already developed and piloted a measurement strategy in the regional dialect of Pidgin English. The first choice, then, was whether to redraw a sample of communities from the region or to work within the subset of our sample where the treatments had not yet been rolled out. If we worked in that subset, we could no longer use our sampling design to draw conclusions about the population average effect for communities in the region. We did not randomize the order in which communities received the treatment for cost reasons: rural sample communities were far-flung and hard to reach across rivers and off-road travel. We attempted to construct model-based weights based on the process our data collection team took in ordering the communities, but we were not confident they exactly represented the process. We then could redraw a sample, which would include some communities that were treated and rely on the experimental property of balance in expectation or block on past randomization in our randomization scheme to avoid imbalances in past treatment status. However, we worried that there could be an interaction effect of the treatment with past treatment status that could introduce bias into our estimates. Given the sampling procedure we chose – a restricted random sample that identified communities separated in distance to avoid geographic-based spillovers – a resample would produce a high proportion of previously treated communities (see map). As a result, we chose to focus on designs within the 109 communities that had not yet been treated.</p>
<p>TODO: add map here</p>
<p>But what randomization procedure and which treatments within those 109? Using an online power calculator, we realized that we could not retain all four factorial conditions and the pure control. We decided that at most we could have two conditions, with about 50 units in each. But which ones? We were reticent to lose the text message or the film treatments, as both tested two different theoretical mechanisms for how to encourage prosocial behaviors. We settled on a step-wedge design crossed with the film treatment to solve this problem. We randomized half of communities to receive the treatment version of the film and half to the placebo version. Then, the stepped-wedge component was that we randomized each community, treatment and placebo, to receive the text blast between 7 and 14 days after the film was distributed. In this way, we could learn from between-community evidence about the effect of the film and within-community over time evidence about the effect of the text messages.</p>
<p>Our final decision was whether to continue. We decided that we had sufficient statistical power for the effect of the film treatment and for the effect of the text message treatment with the new design. And we decided that although we had hoped to produce estimates that directly estimated the population average effect in communities in the region, that we did not expect large heterogeneity in effects across different types of communities so the bias from focusing on the 109 communities that differ from a random sample was not a first order concern.</p>

<!-- - 215 cellphone towers randomly sampled from the universe in four states in Southeastern Nigeria; restricted sampling procedure to prevent samples with proximate towers to reduce the risk of geographic spillovers. randomization design was five conditions: two-by-two factorial treat vs placebo film X treat vs placebo SMS plus pure control with measurement cluster randomized at the tower level.  -->
<!-- - learned as data collection began that the SMS treatment had been misallocated, and the treatment SMS was sent to all conditions accidentally by our partner. over one hundred of the sampled towers were treated. 109 towers were untreated.  -->
<!-- - three dimensions of choice: continue or abandon; resample and randomize; retain or reduce number of treatments -->
<!-- - constraints: treatment was out there in many places and had been text message blasted to every subscriber of the major phone company in the area; the film was produced for this region and filmed in the region, so we could not switch areas with the film treatment. (the whole measurement strategy was region-specific too, in its choice of language and pretesting.) -->
<!-- - ultimate choice: step-wedge design for the SMS crossed with two arm trial of the film.  -->

<h2>
<span class="header-section-number">23.3</span> Populated Preanalysis Plan<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#p4populatedpap"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h2>
<!-- make sure to rename the section title below -->
<p>Inevitably, authors of pre-analysis plans fail to anticipate how, eventually, the data generated by the study will be analyzed. Many of the reasons for the discrepancy were discussed in the previous section on implementation, but other reasons intervene as well. A common reason is that PAPs promise too many analyses – in the process of writing a paper, some analyses are dropped, others are combined, and still others are added during the writing and revision process. In the next section, we’ll describe how to reconcile analyses-as-planned with analyses-as-implemented, but this present section is about what to do with your analysis plan immediately after getting the data back.</p>
<p>We echo proposals made in <span class="citation">Banerjee et al. (<a href="references.html#ref-Banerjee2020" role="doc-biblioref">2020</a>)</span> and <span class="citation">Alrababa’h et al. (<a href="references.html#ref-alrababag_2020" role="doc-biblioref">2020</a>)</span> that researchers should produce short reports that fulfill the promises made in their PAPs. <span class="citation">Banerjee et al. (<a href="references.html#ref-Banerjee2020" role="doc-biblioref">2020</a>)</span> emphasize that writing PAPs is difficult and usually time constrained, so it is natural that the final paper will reflect further thinking about the full set of empirical approaches. A “populated PAP” serves simply to communicate the results of the promised analyses. <span class="citation">Alrababa’h et al. (<a href="references.html#ref-alrababag_2020" role="doc-biblioref">2020</a>)</span> cite the tendency of researchers to abandon publication of studies that return null results. In order to address the resulting publication bias, they recommend “null results reports” that share the results of the pre-registered analyses.</p>
<p>We recommend that authors include mock analyses in their PAPs using mock data. Doing so has the major benefit of being quite specific about the details of the answer strategy. A further benefit comes when it is time to produce a populated PAP, since the realized data can quite straightforwardly be swapped in for the mock data. Given the time invested in producing mock analyses for the PAP, writing up a populated PAP takes only as much effort as is needed to clean the data, which will need to be done in any case.</p>

<p>In Section <a href="#p4planning"><strong>??</strong></a>, we declared the design for <span class="citation">Bonilla and Tillery (<a href="references.html#ref-bonilla_tillery_2020" role="doc-biblioref">2020</a>)</span> following their preanalysis plan. In doing so, we declared an answer strategy in code. In our populated PAP, we can run that same answer strategy code, but swap out the simulated data for the real data collected during the study. We present first the regression table in Table <a href="#tab:bonilatillerypopulatedpapregressiontab"><strong>??</strong></a> and then the coefficient plot in Figure <a href="realization.html#fig:bonilatillerypopulatedpapcoefplot">23.1</a>.</p>

<p>Inevitably, the research design as implemented will differ in some way from the research design as planned. Treatments cannot be implemented as conceived, some people cannot be found to interview, and sometimes what we learn from baseline measures informs how we measure later. An understanding of how your research design changed from conception to implementation is crucial to understanding what was learned from the design.</p>
<p>Suppose the original design described a three-arm trial: one control and two treatments, but the design as implemented drops all subjects assigned to the second treatment. Sometimes this is an entirely appropriate and reasonable design modification: perhaps it turns out that due to an implementation failure, the second treatment was simply not delivered. Other times, these modification is less benign – perhaps the estimate of the effect of the second treatment does not achieve statistical significance, so the author simply omits it from the analysis.</p>
<p>For this reason, explicitly <strong>reconciling</strong> the design as planned with the design as implemented should be the first step to writing up a paper. Having a publicly-posted preanalysis plan can make the reconciliation process especially credible – we know for sure what the planned design was because the preanalysis plan describes it pre-implementation. However, a preanalysis plan is not a prerequisite for engaging in reconciliation. The scientific enterprise is built in large measure on trust: we are ready to believe researchers who say, here is the design I thought I would implement but due to unanticipated developments, here is the design I ended up implementing.</p>
<p>In some cases, reconciliation will lead to additional learning beyond what can be inferred from the final design itself. When some units could refuse to be included in the study sample or some units refused measurement, we learn that important features about those units. Understanding sample exclusions, noncompliance, and attrition not only may inform future research design planning choices, but contribute substantively to our understanding of the social setting. A policy implemented in the same way the study would likely also not be able to work in the units who refused to participate, and future research could examine why or how to convince them of the policy’s benefits.</p>
<p>What belongs in a reconciliation? At a minimum, we need a full description of the planned design, a full description of the implemented design, and a list of the differences. This can be made explicit through the declaration of both designs in computer code, then comparing the two design objects line-by-line.</p>

<p>In Section <a href="#p4planning"><strong>??</strong></a>, we described the preanalysis plan registered by <span class="citation">Bonilla and Tillery (<a href="references.html#ref-bonilla_tillery_2020" role="doc-biblioref">2020</a>)</span>. We reconcile the set of conditional average treatment effect analyses planned in that PAP, the analyses reported in the paper, and those reported on in the appendix at the request of reviewers in Table <a href="realization.html#tab:reconciliation">23.1</a>. In column two, we see that the authors planned four CATE estimates: effects by familiarity with Black Lives Matter; by gender; LGBT status; and linked fate. Only two of those are reported on in the paper, the others may have been excluded for space reasons. The two excluded analyses are not especially informative; they were not excluded on the basis of statistical significance. Another way to handle these uninteresting results would be to present them in a populated PAP posted on their Web site or in the paper’s appendix.</p>
<p>In their appendix, the authors report on a set of analyses requested by reviewers. We see this as a perfect example of transparently presenting the set of planned analyses and highlighting the analyses that were added afterward and why they were added. They write:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We have been asked to consider other pertinent moderations beyond gender and LGBTQ+ status. They are contained in the four following sections.</p>

<!-- make sure to rename the section title below -->
<p>When writing up an empirical paper, the authors must convince reviewers and readers that the question is important and that the research design they selected provides useful answers to the question. This is where MIDA comes in. Elements of MIDA will appear in every section of a paper, and every element of MIDA should be described somewhere in the paper.</p>
<p>A common model for social science empirical papers has five sections: an introduction, theory and hypotheses, research design, results, and discussion. We outline how elements of MIDA can usefully fit into each section here, before providing an example paper highlighting where each element was described.</p>
<p>The introduction section should have a capitulation of each aspect of MIDA in brief. The reader is brought quickly up to speed on the whole research design, as well as expectations and actual findings.</p>
<p>The next section, theory and hypotheses, contains information about the causal model of the world (<span class="math inline">\(M\)</span>) and the research question about the world (<span class="math inline">\(I\)</span>) as well as guesses about <span class="math inline">\(a^M\)</span> (i.e., hypotheses!). The section should lay out all of the features of the model necessary to describe <span class="math inline">\(I\)</span>.</p>
<p>To motivate hypotheses, the theory section should outline our prior beliefs about <span class="math inline">\(a^W\)</span>, the true answer to the inquiry, based on past literature. A meta-analysis or systematic review of past evidence could provide a systematic summary of past answers to <span class="math inline">\(a^W\)</span>, or an informal literature review could be offered. These priors are used along with the study results to construct posterior beliefs reported in the discussion section, i.e., what we know after conducting the study. In summarizing the literature, it is important to consider the research designs of past studies (see Synthesis section). Meta-analyses often formally account for the quality of the research designs of past studies by weighting by the inverse of their precision (upweighting informative studies and down-weighting uninformative ones). Literature reviews may do so informally. Moreover, the summary of past literature is itself a research design, and so we should try to prevent common research design issues such as selection on the dependent variable by ensuring we discuss all literature and not only present views consonant with our hypotheses.</p>
<p>Though research questions are nearly ubiquitously included in the theory section, details of the model are often left out. Expected effect sizes, how effects vary by subgroups, expected proportions of subgroups, how variables are expected to be correlated, and the amount of variability in the outcome are some of the features of the model that will have important effects on how reviewers and readers judge the quality of the research design. Without specifying these portions of <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span>, a diagnosis cannot be conducted. Moreover, we describe in Reanalysis, when you define <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span> yourself in your paper, you can clarify the terms of the debate about alternative analysis strategies. When <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span> is undefined, the author of the reanalysis must infer your model or make up their own, and you may not agree.</p>
<p>The research design or methods section should have a description of <span class="math inline">\(D\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> and a description of a diagnosis of the design. In this section, we defend our choice of <span class="math inline">\(D\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> under <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(I\)</span>. Papers commonly have more than one <span class="math inline">\(D\)</span> and associated <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> answering the same or related questions; both <span class="math inline">\(D\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> for each should be described in this section.</p>
<p>The results section describes <span class="math inline">\(a^D\)</span>. Increasingly, results are presented visually as well as in text, in order to effectively communicate the results to the reader. Visualizing the modeled results as well as the raw data can both improve how the results are communicated and simultaneously help readers connect the research design, the data, and the results.</p>
<p>The discussion section is where we update our understanding of the model and form our posteriors about <span class="math inline">\(a^W\)</span> given our prior expectations and the results <span class="math inline">\(a^D\)</span>. We may learn from the study about new variables and new edges that matter in the model — new outcomes that are affected by a treatment. We also often learn more about the functional form of causal relationships between two variables, for example from new moderators or more precision on the size of the moderation. The discussion section is also a chance to point to new MIDAs that could be implemented to learn more about <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span>. These might relate to new nodes we discovered, or parts of the model that we did not yet learn enough about.</p>
<p>In the Figure below, we illustrate where elements of MIDA are incorporated into <span class="citation">Mousa (<a href="references.html#ref-mousa2020building" role="doc-biblioref">2020</a>)</span>. The study reports on the outcome of a randomized experiment in which Iraqi Christians were assigned either to an all-Christian soccer team or a team in which they would play alongside Muslims. The experiment tested whether being on a mixed team affected intergroup attitudes and behaviors, both among teammates and back at home after the games were over. We highlight in color areas discussing the model <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span> in yellow, the inquiry <span class="math inline">\(I\)</span> in green, the data strategy <span class="math inline">\(D\)</span> in blue, and the answer strategy <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> in pink.</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="figures/mousa-highlighted-sheet.png" alt=""><p class="caption">Paper with MIDA elements highlighted (Mousa 2020)</p>
</div>
<p>The model and the inquiry largely appear in the abstract and introductory portion of the paper, though aspects of the model are discussed later on. Much of the first three pages are devoted to the data strategy, while the answer strategy only appears briefly. This division makes sense: in this paper, the action is all in the experimental design whereas the answer strategy follows straightforwardly from it using the principles of analyze as you randomize. The paper mostly describes <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(D\)</span>, with only a small portion devoted to <span class="math inline">\(I\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span>. Finally, it is notable that the data strategy is interspersed with aspects of the model. The reason is that the author is justifying choices about randomization and measurement using features of the model. This highlights the deep connection between the two discussed in Part II.</p>
<p>Papers often report on the results from multiple data strategies and others on the answers to multiple related inquiries. Typically, a single <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span> should be described in the theory section, which describes how the nodes and edges used in each of the <span class="math inline">\(I\)</span>’s fit together. Each data and strategy should be described, and which inquiries each answer strategy is targeting. Each estimate should be linked to one or more inquiries. In some cases, the reason why multiple inquiries are studied in a single paper is that the aim of the paper is to falsify a model of the world. In this case, the model should be described and the diagnosis of the design should include an assessment of how good the <em>overall</em> design, with data and answer strategies to generate answers to each inquiry, is at falsifying the model. Psychology three-study papers often take this form: study 1 asks about the correlation between X and Y, in study 2 X is randomized, and in study 3 an analysis of the mechanisms that lead between X and Y are examined.</p>

<!-- Publication in peer-reviewed journal is a major goal of many (but not all) research projects.

The reasons reviewers and editors provide when rejecting your paper never seem fair and moreover, never seem like the *real* reasons. It's a frustrating process. -->
<!-- The advice we gave in the previous section on writing papers was to build the case for your findings by grounding your conclusions in the specifics of the research design.

<!-- Eventually, you *will* receive that coveted invitation revise and resubmit your paper, but the reviwers will have made suggestions that are mostly not optional. You will receive comments about all four aspects of the research design. Comments about framing, additional literature to cite, and theoretical distinctions are all about the model. Comments about the research question itself (is the answer already known, is it the right question to be asking) are about the Inquiry. Criticism of data strategy will include comments about the sample quality, the measurement properties of the survey instrument, or requests for replication studies. Many reviewer comments are about specifics of the answer strategy -- you ran OLS, but they want logit; you ran logit so they want to see OLS just to be sure.  -->
<!-- The goal is to respond to reviewer comments in a way that does not compromise the essential strength of your design: do not let the review process make your paper worse. -->
<p>Declaring the MIDA of the research design can help editors and reviewers assess the quality of a research design. When reviewers request changes to your study, declaration of the proposed changes and diagnosis can be used to compare the two possible designs yours and theirs.</p>

<span class="header-section-number">23.6.1</span> Reviewing papers<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#reviewing-papers"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h3>
<p>Reviewers and editors must decide whether to devote scarce space and editing bandwidth to publishing a paper. Criteria may include the topic fit with the journal, the importance of the question, and how much we learned from the research. The problem of the publication filter — publishing only studies with statistically-significant or splashy results — has long been recognized as a cause both of “false” findings making their way into the literature and bias in the literature simply from the missing null findings. One remedy for this problem is results-blind review of studies: selecting studies without knowing the nature of the results.</p>
<p>Results-blind review can take place in multiple ways. Journals have instituted alternative submission paths for “registered reports,” in which authors lay out how they will analyze their data and often include mock tables and figures based on simulated data. These reports can be constructed before or after data is collected. They are closely related to preanalysis plans, in fact often PAPs consist of a registered report.</p>
<p>But results-blind review does not require institutional setup: reviewers can review papers without regard for their results themselves. Reviewers can print out papers and hide results or simply aim to write comments only on the basis of the importance of the question and the quality of the research design.</p>
<p>In both cases, what is needed from authors is a clear statement about the research design and how they will report on and interpret results. Results-blind review need not ignore features of the research design such as how data are displayed and whether authors are overclaiming based on their results. Authors can write plans for how they will visualize and what claims they will make based on different patterns of findings. Journals who institute results-blind review can ensure reviewers are able to judge the quality of the research design by requesting details about <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(I\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(D\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> from authors.</p>

<span class="header-section-number">23.6.2</span> Responding to reviewers<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#responding-to-reviewers"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h3>
<p>The research design of a study is not set in stone until the final version is posted on a journal Web site or published in print. Until then, journal editors and reviewers may ask for changes to answer strategies or even data strategies or inquiries that would, in their view, improve the paper.</p>
<p>The reviewer may make three kinds of requests: an alternative analysis strategy to replace or augment the original; additional data collection; the addition of a new inquiry, based on the same realized data or new data collection; a change to the model in the form of adding or dropping a node or an edge, and with it related changes to other parts of the design; or a change to the inquiry that the reviewer feels can be better answered with the data and answer strategy the author selected.</p>
<p>You can understand how making the changes requested by reviewers alters the design. If the change improves the design, then adopting the suggestions is easy. Some changes are irrelevant to the design – like reporting the reviewer’s preferred descriptive statistics – in which case, following the advice is also easy. The trouble comes when reviewers propose changes that actively undermine the design? If so, diagnosing the reviewer’s alternative design can be an effective way to demonstrate that the proposed changes would harm the research design.</p>
<!-- For example, reviewers sometimes ask authors to explore treatment effect heterogeneity by a number of additional covariates (as in the Bonilla) example. -->
<!-- Three big ideas: -->
<!-- - understand whether a reviewer suggestion improves or diminishes the quality of your design through diagnosis -->
<!-- - use diagnosis and your original declared design (ideally preregistered, but need not be) to defend against reviewer criticisms that *diminish* the quality -->
<!-- - Notes: could also do mediation analysis? What's a good example here? -->
<!-- ### Publication bias -->
<!-- change this to a section on how to review a paper (results blind!) and idea of registered reports -->
<!--  Here we look at risks from publication bias and illustrate two distinct types of upwards bias that arise from  a "[significance filter](https://andrewgelman.com/2011/09/10/the-statistical-significance-filter/)." A journal for publishing null results might help, but the results in there are *also* likely to be biased, *downwards*. -->
<!-- Two distinct problems arise if only significant results are published: -->
<!-- * The results of published studies will be *biased* towards larger magnitudes.  -->
<!-- * The published studies will be *unrepresentative* of the distribution of true effects in the relevant population of studies.  -->
<!-- These two problems are quite distinct. The first problem is more familiar: conditional on any true effect size, larger estimates have an easier time passing the statistical significance filter, so the distribution of published results will be biased upwards because it will be missing all of the smaller estimates.  The second problem is more subtle. If different studies seek to measure effects that are of different size, conditioning on statistical significance means that we are more likely to learn from places that have large effects than from places that have small effects. The significance filter means that our answers to any particular question will be biased *and* it means that the set of questions we see answers to will be biased as well. The *Journal of Significant Results* is a poor guide to the true distribution of causal effects. -->
<!-- What about a *Journal of Null Results*? Such a journal would condition acceptance on *failing* to achieve statistical significance. The set of articles published in such a journal would *also* be biased. -->
<!-- Looking first at the *Journal of Significant Results*, we see the familiar problem: the average estimate is biased away from the true value of the estimand. This problem is greatly helped by increasing the sample size. But we can also see the second problem -- the distribution of estimands (the true effects under study) is also biased towards larger effects, this problem is also allayed, though less dramatically, by larger sample sizes. -->
<!-- The *Journal of Null Results* suffers from a parallel problem, only in reverse. Now estimands are smaller than is typical in the population and, on average, estimates are biased down relative to these estimands. Strikingly, the bias in estimand selection is *worse* at the larger sample size (though downwards bias within the set of published studies is smaller). -->
<!-- Now, we agree that proactively publishing null results may help when considering entire research literatures as a whole, and for this reason alone a *Journal of Null Results* is probably a good thing.  -->
<!-- But, better would be to not do any conditioning at all. The *Journal of Interesting Designs* would condition only on the question being interesting and the design being appropriate to answering the question. We see that the distribution of estimates and estimands are both centered on the correct average value.  -->
