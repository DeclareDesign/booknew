# Is your research question good? 

<!-- - Is the answer to your question known? How would you know? Meta-analysis, systematic review, disagreement in literature
- Is your question important? (Change decisions; change answer in a literature)
- Important question answered poorly / Irrelevant question answered well. We want important questions answered well.

NOTE: for next four sections, four subsections: 1) walk through of how you specify this step, using a probit exposure variable with binary outcome (primary); 2) common choices you have to make about this step; 3) illustrations how these choices have to make for other designs; 4) anticipating cross-MIDA problems from this step. LOTS of pointers to the design library. -->
