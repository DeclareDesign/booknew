# Defining the Inquiry 


<!-- - When would a null finding be interesting? [MH]
- Is the answer defined? (include not only missingness, but ATE for categorical outcomes) [MH]
- What is the set of units which you want to learn the answer about? (since we can't learn about an individual unit) [MH]
- Know what ATE averages over
- Know what is local in a LATE
- Know when SATEs are informative for PATEs
- Choice of inquiry is not valueless
- Make your models vulnerable (something like falsification)
- Relative value of killing bad ideas vs. giving life to good ones
- The many flavors of external validity
- Inquiries for discovery
- Complex counterfactuals -->
