# What is your research question?

## Topics versus Questions

## Causal versus Descriptive Questions

## Types of Causal Questions

<!-- - What is your research question?  
- Topics vs. questions; how to come up with a question - lit review, hunch, data
- research questions often begin with a bivariate "idea" (an x and a y for causal qs, or how does y vary according to x for descriptive)
- Do you want to answer a causal or descriptive question? [MH]
- Typology of questions: COE vs EOC for causal; questions about one of the modes of the distribution of a variable; [MH]
- What is your inquiry if you donâ€™t know the question in advance? (Discovery) -->


## Is your research question good? 

<!-- - Is the answer to your question known? How would you know? Meta-analysis, systematic review, disagreement in literature
- Is your question important? (Change decisions; change answer in a literature)
- Important question answered poorly / Irrelevant question answered well. We want important questions answered well.

NOTE: for next four sections, four subsections: 1) walk through of how you specify this step, using a probit exposure variable with binary outcome (primary); 2) common choices you have to make about this step; 3) illustrations how these choices have to make for other designs; 4) anticipating cross-MIDA problems from this step. LOTS of pointers to the design library. -->
