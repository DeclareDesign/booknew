# Choosing an Answer Strategy

<!-- - Analyze as you randomize when you can (not just for experiments!)
- Reducing variance via estimation choices
- Answer strategy procedures (if this then that). Deal with fishing.
- The role of robustness checks
- PAPs as answer strategies (writing, reconciliation)
- Multiple comparisons 
- Missing data (outcomes, covariates)
