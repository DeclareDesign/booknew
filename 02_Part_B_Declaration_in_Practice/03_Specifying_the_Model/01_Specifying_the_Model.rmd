# Specifying the model

<!-- - Introduce DAGs and potential outcomes
- What is your DAG? How do you write a DAG? What must be in it? What will be missing from it (heterogeneity!)? [MH]
- What parts of background variables must be specified, and how can you specify them (existing data, substantive bounds on variables)
- Isn't defining the effect size for potential outcomes begging the question?
- Pilot studies
- Spillovers are potential outcomes
- Compliance is a potential outcome
- Attrition is a potential outcome 
- Measurements are potential outcomes
