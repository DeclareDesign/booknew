# What is a Design?

We make heavy use of a fairly general framework for describing the core elements of a research design. The basic idea is a research design is a specification of a problem and a strategy to answer it. We build on two influential frameworks. @kkv1994 enumerate four components of a research design: a theory, a research question, data, and an approach to using the data. @geddes2003paradigms articulates the links between theory formation, research question formulation, case selection and coding strategies, and strategies for case comparison and inference. In both cases the set of steps are closely aligned to those in the framework we propose. In the exposition, we also employ elements from @Pearl2009 approach to structural modeling, which provides a syntax for mapping design inputs to design outputs as well as the potential outcomes framework as presented, for example, in @Imbens2015, which many political scientists use to clarify their inferential targets. We characterize the design problem at a high level of generality with the central focus being on the relationship between questions and answer strategies.
