## Using diagnosands to evaluate a design

The ability to calculate distributions of answers, given a model, opens multiple avenues for assessment and critique. How good is the answer you expect to get from a given strategy? Would you do better, given some desideratum, with a different data strategy? With a different analysis strategy? How good is the strategy if the model is wrong in some way or another? 

To allow for this kind of *diagnosis* of a design, we introduce two further concepts, both functions of research designs. These are quantities that a researcher or a third party could calculate with respect to a design. 

* A {\textbf{Diagnostic Statistic}} is a summary statistic generated from a "run" of a design---that is, the results given a possible realization of variables, given the model and data strategy. A diagnostic statistic may or may not depend on the model as well as realized data. For example the statistic: $e=$ "difference between the estimated and the actual average treatment effect" depends on the model (since the ATE depends on the model's assumptions about potential outcomes). The statistic $s = \mathbb{1}(p \leq 0.05)$, interpreted as "the result is considered statistically significant at the 5\% level",'' does not depend on the model but it does presuppose an answer strategy that reports a $p$ value. 
	
	Diagnostic statistics are governed by probability distributions that arise because both the model and the data generation, given the model, may be stochastic.
	
* A *Diagnosand* is a summary of the distribution of a diagnostic statistic. For example, (expected) \emph{bias} in the estimated treatment effect is  $\mathbb{E}(e)$ and statistical \emph{power} is $\mathbb{E}(s)$. 

To illustrate, consider the following design. A model *M* specifies three variables $X$, $Y$ and $Z$ (all defined on the reals). These form the signature. In additional we assume functional relationships between them that allow for the possibility of confounding (for example, $Y =  bX + Z + \epsilon_Y; X = Z+ \epsilon_X$, with $Z, \epsilon_X, \epsilon_Z$ distributed standard normal). The inquiry $I$ is ``what would be the average effect of a unit increase in $X$ on $Y$ in the population?'' Note that this question depends on the signature of the model, but not the functional equations of the model (the answer provided by the model does of course depend on the functional equations). Consider now a data strategy, $D$, in which data is gathered on $X$ and $Y$ for $n$ randomly selected units. An answer $a^A$, is then generated using ordinary least squares as the answer strategy, $A$. 

We have specified all the components of MIDA. We now ask: How strong is this research design? One way to answer this question is with respect to the diagnosand "expected error." Here the model's functional equations provide an answer, $a^M$ to the inquiry (for any draw of $\beta$), and so the distribution of the expected error, *given the model*, $a^A-a^M$, can be calculated.  

In this example the expected performance of the design may be poor, as measured by this diagnosand, because the data and analysis strategy do not handle the confounding described by the model. In comparison, better performance may be achieved through an alternative data strategy (e.g., where $D'$ randomly assigned $X$ to $n$ units before recording $X$ and $Y$) or an alternative analysis strategy (e.g., $A'$  conditions on $Z$). These design evaluations depend on the model, and so one might reasonably ask how performance would look were the model different (for example if the underlying process involved nonlinearities). 

In all cases, the evaluation of a design depends on the assessment of a diagnosand, and comparing the diagnoses to what could be achieved under alternative designs.

In section X we discuss possible choices of diagnosands and operate a set of these
