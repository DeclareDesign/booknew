The transparency revolution says: in order to understand your inferences, I need your code, your data, and your materials.
The credibility revolution says: Some research designs are better than others, lets choose good ones.

Both revolutions have come to social science, but the mix has been different in different disciplines. In psych, transparency has been emphasized; in econ, credibility. Political science has seen a strong mix of both. 

Both are required.



## Before studies

### Pre-Analysis Plans

### Registered Reports

### Standard Operating Procedures

### Evaluating and Supporting Research

## After studies

### Reconciliation

### Replication

### Peers: Better scholarly critique

### Combining designs


Job market papers with multiple studies / three paper paradigm in psych (is it one design targeting same inquiry?) [JC 1p]
Multi-site studies â€“ take a design from another study and use it for another one
Knowledge accumulation


## Improving designs in the social sciences

### A library of research designs as objects
