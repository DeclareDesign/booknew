<p>The Declare-Diagnose-Redesign framework suggests a set of ten principles that can guide the design process. Not all principles will be equally important in all cases but we think all are worth giving consideration when developing and assessing a design.</p>

<h2>
<span class="header-section-number">3.1</span> Design early<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#design-early"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h2>
<p>Research designs can be declared and diagnosed profitably at many stages of the research process, including after implementation or even publication. However, designing early yields big gains. You learn about the properties of a design when there is still time to improve them. Once data strategies are implemented — units sampled, treatments assigned, and outcomes measured — there is no going backwards. The data are already collected. <em>The process of declaring the design may change the design</em>. By revealing how the model, inquiry, data strategy, and answer strategy are interconnected, improvements to each element may be surfaced. If the answer strategy and inquiry are mismatched, the designer faces a choice to change one or the other. If the units sampled in the data strategy are in disharmony with the theoretical model, alternative participants might be sourced. Models may reveal assumptions that require defense through additional data collection. Better inquiries, with more theoretical leverage over the model, may be identified. Inquiries that cannot be answered may be replaced.</p>
<p>Designing early does not mean being inflexible. You can change a design to reflect new knowledge gained during piloting or implementation. But the fact that designs can change later does not take away from the gains from thinking ahead.</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(\rightarrow\)</span> In section <code>X</code> we give examples of how to design in advance when you don’t yet know.</p>
</div>
<div id="select-answerable-inquiries" class="section level2">
<h2>
<span class="header-section-number">3.2</span> Select answerable inquiries<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#select-answerable-inquiries"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h2>
<p>This principle has two components.</p>
<p>First, <em>you should have an inquiry</em>. Oddly, it is possible to do carry out data analysis — for instance, running a regression of <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span> on <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> — and getting something that looks like an answer without specifying any question in particular.<a class="footnote-ref" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content="&lt;p&gt;Loonquawl and Phouchg’s problem.&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>5</sup></a></p>
<p>Second, the question you have should be in principle answerable. We can think of “model-answerable” inquiries and “data-answerable” inquiries.</p>
<p>The idea of model-answerability is that you can write down a model such that, if that model were the true model, and you knew the model, you could answer the question. You can describe the question in terms of the model. Simple sounding questions: “Did Germany cause the Second World War?” “or”did New Zealand do well against Covid-19 because Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern was a woman?" can turn out to be difficult to ask and answer within a model which, we think, can give a hint to when a question is poorly posed. Make sure that you can describe some world in which if you fully understood the world you would have a precise answer to your question.</p>
<p>Data-answerability relates to the idea of “identification.” In statistics, a question is at least partly answerable if there are at least two different sets of data you might observe that would lead you to make two different inferences. In the best case, one might imagine that there is a possible dataset that would give you an imprecise answer. In this case we can think of a model that is identified, or at least partially identified. Perhaps surprisingly, in many circumstances inquiries are not even partially identifiable. If we have a model that says an outcome <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span> is defined by the structural equation <span class="math inline">\(Y=(a+b)X\)</span>, for scalars <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span>, no amount of data can tell us the exact values of <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span>. Indeed without boundary constraints no amount of data can even narrow down the ranges of <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span>. The basic problem is that for any value of <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span> we can choose a <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span> that keeps the sum of <span class="math inline">\(a+b\)</span> constant. In this setting, even though there is an answer to our inquiry (<span class="math inline">\(a\)</span>) it is not one we can ever answer with data. We may want to switch our inquiry to the sum <span class="math inline">\(a+b\)</span>, which is data-answerable. Many other types of inquiries, such as mediation inquiries, are not identifiable. There are some circumstances in which we can provide a partial answer to the inquiry, such as learning a range of values within which the parameter lives. These can be useful. At a minimum, our inquiries should be at least partially answerable with possible data.</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(\rightarrow\)</span> In section <code>X</code> we give an example of a design that sought to answer a question that turned out to be unanswerable.</p>
</div>
<div id="render-inquiries-insensitive-to-models" class="section level2">
<h2>
<span class="header-section-number">3.3</span> Render inquiries insensitive to models<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#render-inquiries-insensitive-to-models"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h2>
<p>Sometimes researchers write down a model and then point to some model-specific quantity that they want to lean about. For example you assume that <span class="math inline">\(Y= \alpha+\beta X\)</span> and you want to learn about <span class="math inline">\(\beta\)</span>. The problem with this approach however is that it is not very clear what the <em>question</em> is (and similarly, what the estimand is) if you have the wrong model. For instance what is the researcher asking if in fact the “true” model is <span class="math inline">\(Y= X - X^2\)</span>? For a second example it is unclear what the average treatment effect inquiry <span class="math inline">\(E(Y(1)-Y(0))\)</span> is if our model allows for spillovers. One approach is to require that readers assume our model is true and so the question is well defined. But this has the distinct disadvantage of preventing us from even <em>asking</em> how the design woudl perform if the model is wrong. A better approach is to define the inquiry in a way that requires as few assumptions as possible about the world. For instance instance instead of <span class="math inline">\(\beta\)</span> we could say that we are interested in the average effect on <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span> of a unit change in <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span>. Similarly we can redefine the average treatment effect, however, as the average difference between a unit being the only unit treated and a situation where all other units being assigned to control.</p>
<p>In practice we encourage you to define inquiries as summaries terms of the values (or potential values) of nodes of a model. If you do that then the definition depends only on what’s called the “signature” of the model—the set of nodes and their ranges—and not specific assumptions about how nodes relate to each other—the structural equations.</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(\rightarrow\)</span> In section <code>X</code> we show an example of a design that seeks to estimate deep parameters from a structural model but using an approach where the question does not depend on the model being correct.</p>

</h2>
<p>A useful feature that you can see from the MIDA formalism is that when data strategies introduce no distortions, answer strategies can be directly analogous to inquiries. If the data <span class="math inline">\(d\)</span> is like the distributions generated by <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span> then if <span class="math inline">\(A=I\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(A(d)\)</span> will be like <span class="math inline">\(I(m)\)</span>. We call this the plug-in principle: the estimator can be like the inquiry. The principle does not always hold but there is an interesting generalization. When data strategies do introduce distortions, the answer strategy should compensate for them to restore parallelism. If we define inquiries in terms of potential outcomes, then our estimand can be written <span class="math inline">\(I(X(m))\)</span>, where <span class="math inline">\(X(m)\)</span> denotes values of nodes produced under model <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span>. We get to observe <span class="math inline">\(d=D(m)\)</span> and our answer is <span class="math inline">\(A(D(m))\)</span>. Ideally we want <span class="math inline">\(A(D(m)) = I(X(m))\)</span>. We preserve parallelism then by seeking an <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> such that <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> after <span class="math inline">\(D\)</span> approximates <span class="math inline">\(I\)</span> after <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span>.</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(\rightarrow\)</span> We show plug-in principles in action in section <code>X</code>.</p>

</h2>
<p>A common approach to research planning is to write down the ideal design, then go implement it, encounter problems, and seek fixes. Missing data, archival documents that cannot be traced, noncompliance with treatment assignments, evidence of spillovers, and difficulties recontacting subjects in followup surveys are just some of the common problems empirical researchers face. Insofar as these are predictable problems it can be useful to think of them as <em>parts</em> of your design not <em>deviations</em> from your design. Answer strategies can be developed that anticipate these problems, and account for them, including if-then plans for handling each likely implementation problem. More fundamentally, the deviations themselves can be included in your model so that you can diagnose the properties of different strategies, in advance, given risks of different kinds.</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(\rightarrow\)</span> Section <code>X</code> gives an example of a design that incorporates risks of non-random attrition.</p>

</h2>
<p>In evaluating designs, researchers often focus on quite narrow criteria, or what we call diagnosands, and consider them in isolation. Is the estimator unbiased? Do I have statistical power? But the evaluation of a design often requires balancing multiple criteria: scientific precision, logistical constraints, policy goals, as well ethical considerations. Each of these goals can be specified as a function of an implementation of the design. The cost is straightforward, a function translating the number of units and the amount of time it took to collect and analyze data about them into a financial value. Scientific goals may be represented in a number of ways, such as the root mean-squared error or statistical power or most directly the amount of learning between before and after the study was conducted. Ethical goals may also be translated into functions. An ethical diagnosand might be the number of minutes of time taken from participants of the study or whether any participants were harmed in the study.</p>
<p>A diagnosis of five designs across ethical, logistical, and scientific diagnosands provides us with our own multidimensional value statement of each design. We then should select the optimal design, subject to feasibility. Putting this into practice forces us to provide a weighting scheme between ethical, logistical, and scientific values. Those weighting schemes may be that either the study is ethical and we do it or it is not ethical and we do not do it. Or there may be tradeoffs we navigate between the amount of time taken up of subjects and the scientific value of a larger sample that imply choosing a middle ground.</p>

</h2>
<p>Too often, researchers evaluate <em>parts</em> of their design in isolation: is this a good question? Is this a good estimator? What’s the best way to sample? However, evaluation of a design requires knowing how the parts fit together. If we ask, “What’s your research design?” and you respond “It’s a regression discontinuity design,” we’ve learned what your answer strategy might be, but we don’t have enough information to decide whether it’s a strong design until we learn about the model, inquiry, data strategy, and answer strategy. In practice we do this by declaring the entire design, and asking how it performs, from start to finish, with respect to specified diagnosands.<a class="footnote-ref" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content="&lt;p&gt;This presupposes of course that we &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; run through a design from start to finish, that the design is whole enough to let us do that.

</h2>
<p>You may well feel that you are done once you fully declare a design that promises to answer the questions you care about. That is the point however when you can most easily think through the performance of your design relative to alternatives. The redesign stage is centered on identifying all of the feasible data and answer strategies and then diagnosing each feasible design. The feasible set may include many minor variations in sampling and assignment probabilities and sample sizes or it may include several very different designs that could be accomplished within ethical and logistical constraints. The diagnosis can be conducted across multiple feasible combinations of the different dimensions of the designs which address the problem that it is difficult to predict how features in different parts of the data and answer strategies will interact.</p>

<h2>
<span class="header-section-number">3.9</span> Know where it breaks<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#know-where-it-breaks"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h2>
<p>Design declaration and diagnosis can usefully be used to show a set of conditions under which a design works. Given some model and some strategy faithfully implemented, we get a reliable answer with high probability. But designs can also be used to get clarity over when a design will <em>not</em> produce a good answer, even when you have built in failures of implementation. Your design might assume for instance that one variable is not affected by another variable and the validity of your answer might depend on the extent to which this is true. A design that contains a set of models that include violations of this assumption can be used to asses the extent to which the assumption matters, how bad a violation has to be to produce misleading results of consequence, and what types of assumptions are critical for inference and which ones are not. In short, seek to construct a model set do you can understand the worlds for which your design works and the worlds in which you run into problems.</p>
<p>Research design diagnosis is useful only if the design is assessed not only under conditions favorable to the researcher, but those unfavorable to the researcher. Designs should provide useful answers to inquiries in both sets of circumstances. Diagnosis under both sets can reveal if that is the case, or if changes to the data and answer strategy are needed. Even when there are circumstances under which the design performs poorly, understanding when that is the case aids interpretation of the results and focuses reanalysis debates substantively on which models are plausible.</p>

</h2>
<p>We emphasized designing early and we often have an image of designing first and implementing later. But in practice as you implement your design, it might change. Sample sizes change, measures change, estimation strategies change. Sometimes even your questions change.</p>
<p>These features might not have been part of your original design but they are part of your design once they happen. In such cases you can redesign, assess the properties of the updated design, and compare it to the old design. There are three reasons for doing this, with both immediate and longterm consequences. Most immediately, when unforeseen changes to budgets, time availability, or other logistical constraints appear or when something goes wrong in implementation, we should ask ourselves two questions: given the stage we are at, what is the best design, even if different than originally envisioned? And is it worth implementing this new, modified design? Declaring the new design, diagnosing it, and finding the new optimal design subject to constraints will answer the first question. Then deciding whether the value of the new design, assessed through the diagnosands, is worth its cost. The new design may have a different ethical status, cost, and scientific value and thus sometimes it may not be worth continuing given the new reality. Redesign and diagnosis help navigate these two decisions.</p>
