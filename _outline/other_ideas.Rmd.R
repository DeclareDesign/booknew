# Designs brainstorm

- geographic RD
- spatial processes
- IRT
- country-year FE
- EITM
- computational evolutional models
- mapping social networks
- an ANES study
- interrupted time series
- time series (uninterrupted)
- selection on observables
- "is this a good predictor"
- need to but the handbook of lab experiments
- weighting to get PATEs and SATEs under non-compliance and non-response when you have a baseline
