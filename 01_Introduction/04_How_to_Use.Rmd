# How to use this book


Explanation of what the four parts do.

Part I. Overview is self-contained. It could be assigned in substantive courses that need a bit on research design.
Part II. This is where we get into MIDA declaration, diagnosands, and redesign in full detail. This section could be assigned in courses specifically about research design.
Part III. A design library split up by  the intersection of D and I. (observational - causal, observational descriptive etc.)
Part IV. Communicating design choices (paps, design documents, funding applications, journal articles) and making decisions (should I do this study, should it be funded, should it be published.)


1. Working through the code and exercises. This requires investment in R, the tidyverse and the DeclareDesign set of software packages. We think it's very rewarding but we understand that there is a learning curve. You could, of course, tackle the declaration, diagnosis, and redesign processes using bespoke simulations in any computer language you like.

2. Skipping all code and exercises and just focusing on the text. We've self-consciously written the book so that understanding of the code is not required in order to understand the research design concepts under discussions.

3. You could use this book as a cookbook reference to learn about the common research designs described in Part III. While we of course draw heavily on Part II in Part III, a Part I-level understanding is sufficient for getting a lot out of the design library entries
