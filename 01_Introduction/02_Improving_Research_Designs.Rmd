# Improving research designs

As empirical social scientists, we routinely face two research design problems. First, we need to select high-quality designs, given financial and practical constraints. Second, we need to communicate those designs to readers and reviewers. To select strong designs, we often rely on rules of thumb, simple power calculators, or principles from the methodological literature that typically address one component of a design while assuming optimal conditions for others. These relatively informal practices can result in the selection of suboptimal designs, or worse, designs that are simply too weak to deliver useful answers. To convince others of the quality of our designs, we often defend them with references to previous studies that used similar approaches, with power analyses that may rely on assumptions unknown even to ourselves, or with ad hoc simulation code. In cases of dispute over the merits of different approaches, disagreements sometimes fall back on first principles or epistemological debates rather than on demonstrations of the conditions under which one approach does better than another.

In this paper we describe an approach to address these problems. We introduce a framework --- MIDA --- that asks researchers to specify information about their background model (M), their inquiry (I), their data strategy (D), and their answer strategy (A). We then introduce the notion of "diagnosands," or quantitative summaries of design properties. Familiar diagnosands include statistical power, the bias of an estimator with respect to an estimand, or the coverage probability of a procedure for generating confidence intervals. 

Many aspects of design quality can be assessed through design diagnosis, but many cannot. For instance the contribution to an academic literature, relevance to a policy decision, and impact on public debate are unlikely to be quantifiable ex ante.

Using this framework, researchers can declare a research design as a computer code object and then diagnose its statistical properties on the basis of this declaration. A researcher may declare the features of designs in our framework for their own understanding and declaring designs may be useful before or after the research is implemented. Researchers can declare and diagnose their designs with the companion software for this paper, DeclareDesign, but the principles of design declaration and diagnosis do not depend on any particular software implementation.

The formal characterization and diagnosis of designs before implementation can serve many purposes. First, researchers can learn about and improve their inferential strategies. Done at this stage, diagnosis of a design and alternatives can help a researcher select from a range of designs, a process we call "redesign." Later, a researcher may include design declaration and diagnosis as part of a preanalysis plan or in a funding request. At this stage, the full specification of a design serves a communication function and enables third parties to understand a design and an authorâ€™s intentions. Even if declared ex-post, formal declaration still has benefits. The characterization can help readers understand the properties of a research project, facilitate transparent replication, and can help guide future (re-)analysis of the study data.

## Design Declaration: Model-Inquiry-Data Strategy-Answer Strategy

A declaration of a research design comprises four components: a causal *model* of the world, which defines a set of units we want to learn about, a set of variables that represent characteristics of the units, and how those variables interact; a research *inquiry*, which is a function of variables defined in the model; a *data strategy* to intervene in the world to learn an answer to the inquiry, including interventions that are implemented but also measurement that is collected; and an *answer strategy* that defines how we construct an answer to the inquiry from the data that results from implementing our data strategy. The four together, which we refer to as MIDA, represent both your suppositions about how the world works and the choices you make as the researcher to intervene in and learn about the world. 

The model defines a set of units, people or neighborhoods or social groups, that we wish to study. Often, this set of units is a large population of units we cannot afford to take measurements of, but we can nevertheless define and make inferences about through sampling and studying a subset of its units. The model then includes a set of baseline characteristics that describe each unit and the probability distributions of each characteristic (i.e., are heights normally distributed, or is there skew that comes from stunting in infants). Finally, the model includes a set of endogenous outcome variables that may be functions of exogenous (pretreatment) characteristics and the effects of interventions. Each endogenous outcome variable has a function that defines the variables that affect what values it takes on. When an outcome depends on an intervention, it will be a potential outcome, where we can define what value the outcome would take on if a unit received the treatment and what outcome that unit would take on if it did not receive the treatment. Typically, endogenous outcome variables are random variables, either because it is a function of an exogenous baseline variable for which we defined a probability distributions or because whether a unit is assigned to treatment or control is randomly assigned as part of the data strategy.

Defining the model can feel like an odd exercise. Since researchers presumably want to learn about the model, declaring it in advance may seem to beg the question. Yet declaring a model is often unavoidable when declaring reserach designs. In practice, doing so is already familiar to any researcher who has calculated the power of a design, which requires the specification of effect sizes. The seeming arbitrariness of the declared model can be mitigated by assessing the sensitivity of diagnosis to alternative models and strategies (see Section XX). Further, researchers can inform their substantive models with existing data, such as baseline surveys. Just as power calculators focus attention on minimum detectable effects, design declaration offers a tool to demonstrate design properties and how they change depending on researcher assumptions.

The second component of a research design is the inquiry, often known as the estimand. This is a quantity that represents the true answer to the research question we are asking. Inquiries may be causal, as in the average treatment effect, or descriptive, as in the proportion of units who hold a certain characteristic. An inquiry is a function of the exogenous characteristics of units, of endogenous outcome variables, or both. It may be defined over all units in the population defined by the model, as in the average treatment effect for all units, or it may be defined over a subset of units, as in the conditional average treatment effect for women. Because we defined the distribution of the variables in the model, we can define the probability distribution of inquiries, which are a function of those variables. 

The data strategy defines how the researcher, along with research partners, intervenes in the world to generate an answer to the question posed by the inquiry. The researcher must select a sampling strategy for measurement, which could be to take measurements of all units or to first sample a subset of units. It includes the treatments and treatment assignment procedures. And it includes the measurement procedure itself, defining the set of survey questions or administrative data that will be collected from selected units. In short, the data strategy is everything the researcher does to obtain a set of data or observations used to answer the inquiry about the world.

With the data that results from the data strategy, the answer strategy defines a set of procedures the researcher uses to translate the data into an answer to the inquiry. It is not simply the choice of an estimator, such as OLS or logit, but the full set of procedures from receiving the dataset to providing the answer in words, tables, and graphs. This includes data cleaning, data transformation, estimation, plotting, and interpretation. Not only the choice of OLS must be defined, but that we will focus attention on the coefficient estimate from the `Z` variable and assess uncertainty using a confidence interval and construct a coefficient plot in a certain way to visualize the inference. The answer strategy also includes all of the if-then procedures that researchers implicitly or explicitly take depending on initial results and features of the data. In a stepwise regression procedure, the answer strategy is not the final regression that results from iterative model selection, but that procedure itself -- because the answer will depend on features of that change depending on sampling variability. Just like the values of the inquiry, the values of the estimates that result from the answer strategy have a probability distribution, because they are the result of the variables defined in the model (which have probability distributions) and the data strategy (sampling and treatment assignment are defined by probability distributions). 

Declaring a design entails separating out which parts of your idea belong in $M$, $I$, $D$, and $A$. The declaration process can be a challenge because mapping your ideas and excitement about your project into MIDA is not always straightforward. We promise it is a rewarding task. When you can express your research design in terms of these four components you are newly able to think about its properties. 

<!-- MIDA captures the analysis-relevant features of a design, but it does not describe substantive elements, such as how theories are derived, how interventions are implemented, or even, qualitatively, how outcomes are measured. Yet many other aspects of a design that are not explicitly labeled in these features enter into this framework if they are analytically relevant. For example, if treatment effects decay, logistical details of data collection (such as the duration of time between a treatment being administered and endline data collection) may enter into the model. Similarly, if a researcher anticipates noncompliance, substantive knowledge of how treatments are taken up can be included in many parts of the design. -->


### Example: @Gulzar2020

In an experiment in two districts in Pakistan, @Gulzar2020 study how to motivate citizens to run for political office for the first time. Thus, their set of units is all citizens in Haripur and Abbottabad, about whom they consider baseline policy preferences, in order to characterize how different the policy preferences of citizens are from those eventually elected. Their endogenous outcomes of interest are whether the citizen filed papers to run for office; was elected; and the Euclidean distance from average citizen preferences. The outcomes are a function in their causal model of three treatments, which emphasize either the social or personal benefits to holding public office or do not encourage anyone to run for office at all. Their model would include an expected treatment effect magnitude for each treatment and their suppositions about how correlated outcomes are within villages that they study. 

```{r}
gulzar_khan_design <- 
  
  declare_population(
    # study is conducted in two districts in Pakistan, with 311 and 359 villages in them
    districts = add_level(N = 2, name = c("Haripur", "Abbottabad"), N_villages = c(311, 359)),
    
    # villages nested within districts
    villages = add_level(N = N_villages),
    
    # avg. 6500 citizens per village
    citizens = add_level(N = 6500)
  ) +
  
  # main outcome is whether a citizen filed papers to run for office
  # we define potential outcomes in response to being assigned to a social, personal, or neutral appeal to run
  declare_potential_outcomes(
    filed_papers ~ rbinom(N, 1, prob = 0.05 + 0.05 * (Z_appeal == "social") + 0.01 * (Z_appeal == "personal")),
    assignment_variable = Z_appeal, conditions = c("neutral", "social", "personal")
  ) + 
  
  # inquiry is the difference in rates of filing papers between the social and personal appeal conditions
  declare_estimand(ATE = mean(filed_papers_Z_appeal_social - filed_papers_Z_appeal_personal)) + 
  
  # sample 192 villages
  declare_sampling(clusters = villages, n = 192, sampling_variable = "S_villages") + 
  
  # sample 48 citizens in each village via random walk
  declare_sampling(strata = villages, n = 48, sampling_variable = "S_citizens") + 
  
  # assign villages to three arms with equal probabilities for three types of appeals to run for office
  declare_assignment(
    m_each = c(48, 72, 72),
    clusters = villages,
    conditions = c("neutral", "social", "personal"),
    assignment_variable = Z_appeal
  ) + 
  
  # recode treatment assignment for analysis into indicators for the two conditions of interest
  declare_step(
    Z_social_village = if_else(Z_appeal == "social", 1, 0),
    Z_personal_village = if_else(Z_appeal == "personal", 1, 0),
    handler = mutate
  ) +
  
  # 1. run a linear regression with condition indicators
  # 2. calculate the difference in effects between people in villages assigned to social appeals compared
  #    to those assigned to personal appeals
  # 3. calculate robust standard errors clustered on village
  declare_estimator(
    filed_papers ~ Z_social_village + Z_personal_village, 
    linear_hypothesis = "Z_social_village - Z_personal_village = 0",
    term = "Z_social_village - Z_personal_village = 0",
    clusters = villages,
    model = lh_robust
  )
```

The inquiry is the average difference in the rate of filing papers to run for office between people living in villages randomly assigned to receive an encouragement to vote focused on prosocial motivations for officeholding compared to those to whom personal benefits were emphasized.

The data strategy in @Gulzar2020 entailed three steps: (1) randomly sampling 192 villages from among all villages in Haripur and Abbottabad districts, and using a random walk procedure to select 48 citizens in each village to participate in the experiment; (2) randomly-assigning each village with equal probability to one of three conditions (neutral, social benefits, or personal benefits); and (3) collecting administrative data on who filed papers to run and matching that back to pretreatment survey data on the 9,216 citizens. Sampling, treatment assignment, and measurement are the three common data strategy steps in an experiment; some experiments, instead, do not include a sampling step and instead assign treatments within a convenience sample. 

@Gulzar2020 have a two-step answer strategy, fitting a linear model predicting whether a citizen ran for office (the outcome) with indicators for the social benefits and the personal benefits treatments, and then calculating the difference between the two coefficients as an estimate of whether social benefits are more or less effective than the personal benefits. Their answer strategy includes presenting a table with estimated difference, a standard error clustered on village to account for village-level random assignment, and a p-value calculated using permutation inference.

## Assessing research design quality: design diagnosis

Once you've declared your design, you can diagnose it. Design diagnosis is the process of simulating your research design in order to understand the range of possible ways the study could turn out. It is in the diagnosis stage that we define the design properties that are most desirable in our research setting. We let computers do the simulations for us because imagining how design choices influence sampling distributions is --- to put it lightly --- cognitively demanding. 

Diagnosis is an opportunity to write down what would make the study a success. For a long time, researchers have classified studies as successful or not based on statistical significance. Accordingly, statistical power (the probability of a statistically significant result) has been the most front-of-mind diagnosand when researchers have set to designing studies. As we learn more about the pathologies of relying on the statistical significance, we learn that diagnosands beyond power are just as, if not more important. For example, the "credibility revolution" throughout social science has trained a laser-like focus on the bias diagnosand. Studies are coming under new criticism for lacking "strong identification," which usually implies that the data and answer strategies could lead to biased answers depending on how incorrect the model is. Randomized experimentation promises unbiased answers, at least when the data and answer strategies are implemented well.

Design diagnosis relies on two further concepts, both functions of research designs. These are quantities that a researcher or a third party could calculate with respect to a design. 

The first is a **diagnostic statistic,** which is a summary statistic generated from a "run" of a design---that is, the results given a possible realization of variables, given the model and data strategy. For example the statistic: $e=$ "difference between the estimated and the actual average treatment effect" depends on the model (since the ATE depends on the model's assumptions about potential outcomes). The statistic $s = \mathbb{1}(p \leq 0.05)$, interpreted as "the result is considered statistically significant at the 5% level," does not depend on the model but it does presuppose an answer strategy that reports a $p$-value. Diagnostic statistics are governed by probability distributions that arise because both the model and the data generation, given the model, may be stochastic.

Second, a **diagnosand** is a summary of the distribution of a diagnostic statistic. For example, \emph{bias} is average value of the $e$ statistic and \emph{power} is is the average value of the $s$ statistic. Other diagnosands include things like root-mean-squared-error (RMSE), Type I, Type II, Type M, and Type S error rates. 

One especially important diagnosand is the "success rate," which is the average value of the "success" diagnostic statistic. As a researcher, *you* get to decide what would make your study a success.  What matters most in your research scenario? Is it statistical significance? If so, optimize your design with respect to power. Is what matters most in your research setting with the answer has the correct sign or not? Then diagnose how frequently your answer strategy yields an answer with the same sign as your inquiry. Diagnosis is an opportunity for you to articulate what would make your study a success and then to simulate how often you obtain that success.

## Redesign

The subtitle of this book is "Declaration, Diagnosis, Redesign" to emphasize three important steps in the conceptualization of a research design. So far, we've outlined the first two points: declaration and diagnosis. Once your design has been declared, and you have learned to diagnose it with respect to the most important diagnosands, the last step is redesign.

Redesign entails playing with each of the design parameters to understand the implications of each for your most important diagnosands. This can mean a variety of things. Many diagnosands (power, RMSE) depend on the size of the study. We can redesign the study, varying the "sample size" feature of the data strategy to determine how big it needs to be to achieve a target diagnosand: 90% power, say, or an RMSE of 0.02. We could also vary an aspect of the answer strategy, say, the covariates used to adjust a regression model. Sometimes the changes to the data and answer strategies interact: if we use better covariates to increase the precision of the estimates in the answer strategy, we have to collect that information as a part of the data strategy. The redesign question now becomes, is it better to collect pre-treatment information from all subjects or is the money better spent on increasing the total number of subjects? Finally, redesign sometimes means changing the model. That is, sometimes we want to understand whether our design yields the right inferences even when the underlying data generating processes shift beneath our feet. In summary, redesign entails enumerating a set of possible designs given resource and theoretical constraints then picking the best one.


## Formalizing design declaration, diagnosis, and redesing.

In this section, we set the our approach on firmer mathematical grounds. In doing so, we employ elements from Pearl's [-@Pearl2009] approach to causal modeling (directed acycling graphs, or DAGs for short), which provides a syntax for mapping design inputs to design outputs. We also use the potential outcomes framework as presented, for example, in @Imbens2015, which many social scientists use to clarify their inferential targets. We'll dive much more deeply into both DAGs and potential outcomes in Part II.

### Formalizing MIDA

A research design $\Delta$ includes four elements $<M,I,D,A>$:

A **model**, $M$, of how the world works. In general following Pearl's definition of a probabilistic causal model we will assume that a model contains three core elements. First, a specification of the variables $X$ about which research is being conducted. This includes endogenous and exogenous variables ($V$ and $U$ respectively) and the ranges of these variables. In the formal literature this is sometimes called the *signature* of a model [@halpern2000]. Second, a specification of how each endogenous variable depends on other variables (the "functional relations" or, as in @Imbens2015, "potential outcomes"), $F$. Third, a probability distribution over exogenous variables, $P(U)$. We write a draw from this distribution as $M() = m$.  

An **inquiry**, $I$, about the distribution of variables, $X$, perhaps given interventions on some variables. Using Pearl's notation we can distinguish between questions that ask about the conditional values of variables, such as $\Pr(X_1 | X_2 =1)$ and questions that ask about values that would arise under interventions: $\Pr(X_1 | do(X_2 = 1))$. The distinction lies in whether the conditional probability is recorded through passive observation or active intervention to manipulate the probabilities of the conditioning distribution. For example, $\Pr(X_1 | X_2 =1)$ might indicate the conditional probability that it is raining, given that Jack has his umbrella, whereas $\Pr(X_1 | do(X_2 =1))$ would indicate the probability with which it would rain, given that Jack is made to carry an umbrella. We let $a^M$ denote the answer to $I$ \textit{under the model}. Conditional on the model, $a^M$ is the value of the estimand, the quantity that the researcher wants to learn about. The connection of $a^M$ to the model can be seen in the following equality: $I(m) = a^M$.

A **data** strategy, $D$, generates data $d$ on $X$. Data $d$ arises, under model $M$ with probability $P_M(d|D)$. The data strategy includes sampling strategies and assignment strategies, which we denote with $P_S$ and $P_Z$ respectively. Measurement techniques are also a part of data strategies and can be thought of as a selection of observable variables that carry information about unobservable variables. The data strategy operates on a draw from the model to produce the observed data: $D(m) = d$.

An **answer** strategy, $A$, that generates answer $a^D$ using data $d$. We encode this relationship as $A(d) = a^D$.

The full set of causal relationships between $M$, $I$, $D$, and $A$ with respect to $m$, $a^M$, $d$ and $a^D$ can be seen in the DAG schematic representation of a research design.

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="testing"}
dag <-
  dagify(m ~ M,
         aM ~ m + I,
         d ~ D + m,
         aA ~ A + d)

gg_df <-
  tidy_dagitty(
    dag,
    layout = "manual",
    x = c(4, 3, 2, 1, 3, 1, 4, 2),
    y = c(1.1, 1.1, 1.1, 1.1, 1, 1, 1, 1)
  )

gg_df <-
  gg_df %>%
  mutate(arced = (name == "m" & to == "d"),) %>%
  arrange(name)


g <-
  ggplot(data = filter(gg_df, !arced), aes(
    x = x,
    y = y,
    xend = xend,
    yend = yend
  )) +
  geom_dag_node(color = "gray") +
  geom_dag_text(color = "black",
                parse = TRUE,
                label = TeX(c(
                  "A",
                  "a^D",
                  "a^M",
                  "d",
                  "D",
                  "I",
                  "m",
                  "M"
                )),
                size = 4) +
  geom_dag_edges() +
  geom_dag_edges_arc(data = filter(gg_df, arced), curvature = -0.025) +
  theme_dag()
g
```

The tight correspondence between $I(m) = a^M$ and $A(d) = a^D$ points out how a research design is a correspondence between two joint distributions and their summaries. The joint distributions described by $M$ and $D$ are causally related, but they are distinct. $M$ reflects our beliefs about true underlying causal processes at work where $D$ is the procedure that results in the collection or creation of data. (The phrase "data generating process" can be a little confusing -- usually people use "true DGP" to refer to $M$, even though $M$ doesn't create data, $D$ does).  $I$ is a summary of a draw from $M$ ($m$); $A$ is a summary of a draw from $D$ ($d$). 

### Formalizing Diagnosis

Research designs are stronger when the distributions of $a^M$ and $a^M$ are more similar. To characterize how close the two distributions are, we turn to research design *diagnosis*.  Design diagnosis is the process of simulating both $I(m) = a^M$ and $A(d) = a^M$ over many draws from $M()$ and $D(m)$, and comparing them.

A "diagnostic statistic" is (usually) a scalar function $g()$ of both $a^M$ and $a^D$, though some diagnostic statistics may be a function of just one or the other.  [CAN DIAGNOSTIC STATISTICS BE VECTOR VALUED?] 


$$
\Gamma = g(a^M, a^D)
$$

Because $a^M$ and $a^D$ are random variables, and any function of random variables is also a random variable, $\Gamma$ is itself a random variable. A diagnosand is a summary of that random variable. Just like we summarise random variables with statistical functionals like the expectation and variance operators, a diagnosand is a statistical functional of the diagnostic statistic random variable $\Gamma$. 

$$
\phi = f(\Gamma)
$$

Since $f()$ is a statistical functional (like $E[]$ or $V[]$), it is itself *not* a random variable. It is a description of the distribution of the random variable $\Gamma$. We'll use the greek letter $\phi$ to describe the idea of a diagnosand in general.

Let's back up a moment to work through a concrete example of a diagnosand. Consider the diagnosand "bias". Bias is the average difference between the estimand and the estimate. Under a model that has two potential outcomes, a treated potential outcome and an untreated potential outcome, the inquiry might be the ATE. Under a single realization $m$ of the model $M$, the value of the ATE will be a particular number, which we call $a^M$. If our data strategy is simply to collect data on those who come to be treated versus those who don't (i.e., we do not use random assignment), and our answer strategy is difference-in-means, our answer $a^D$ could be systematically different from $a^M$. The diagnostic statistic is the error $a^D - a^M$; this error is a random variable because each draw of $m$ from $M$ is slightly different. The expectation of this random variable is $E[a^D - a^M]$, which is bias. 

Similarly, the common diagnosand power is also an expectation. It is the expectation of the diagnostic statistic $\mathbb{1}p <= 0.05$, which is an indicator function that equals 1 if the $p$-value is below 0.05 and 0 otherwise. 

A key feature of this bare specification is that if $M$, $D$, and $A$ are sufficiently well described, the answer to question $I$ has a distribution $P_M(a^D|D)$. Moreover, one can construct a distribution of comparisons of this answer to the correct answer, under $M$, for example by assessing $P_M(a^M-a^D|D)$.

Some diagnosands can be calculated analytically, though most require Monte Carlo computer simulation. A main purpose of the DeclareDesign software package is making the simulation step easier.

### Formalizing Redesign

Diagnosis the process of learning the value of a diagnosand for a single design. Redesign is the process of *changing* parts of MIDA in order to learn how the diagnosands change. The redesign process is complete when a research selects the best (or one of the best) design among the feasible set, as measured by the changing values of the diagnosand.

For example, we can compare how the distribution of errors changes if we use a different data strategy $D'$: $P_M(a^M-a^D|D')$ or a different answer strategy $A'$: $P_M(a^M-a^{A'}|D)$. We can also hold the data and answer strategies fixed and consider the distribution of errors under an alternative model $M'$: $P_M(a^{M'}-a^{A}|D)$.

In all cases, the full evaluation of a design (declaration, diagnosis, redesign) depends on the assessment of a diagnosand, and comparing the diagnoses to what could be achieved under alternative designs.

### Brief Illustration

To illustrate, consider the following design. A model *M* specifies three variables $X$, $Y$ and $Z$ (all defined on the reals). These form the signature. In additional we assume functional relationships between them that allow for the possibility of confounding (for example, $Y =  bX + Z + \epsilon_Y; X = Z+ \epsilon_X$, with $Z, \epsilon_X, \epsilon_Z$ distributed standard normal). The inquiry $I$ is ``what would be the average effect of a unit increase in $X$ on $Y$ in the population?'' Note that this question depends on the signature of the model, but not the functional equations of the model (the answer provided by the model does of course depend on the functional equations). Consider now a data strategy, $D$, in which data is gathered on $X$ and $Y$ for $n$ randomly selected units. An answer $a^D$, is then generated using ordinary least squares as the answer strategy, $A$.

We have specified all the components of MIDA. We now ask: How strong is this research design? One way to answer this question is with respect to the diagnosand "expected error." Here the model's functional equations provide an answer, $a^M$ to the inquiry (for any draw of $\beta$), and so the distribution of the expected error, *given the model*, $a^D-a^M$, can be calculated. In this example the expected performance of the design may be poor, as measured by this diagnosand, because the data and analysis strategy do not handle the confounding described by the model.

In comparison, better performance may be achieved through an alternative data strategy (e.g., where $D'$ randomly assigned $X$ to $n$ units before recording $X$ and $Y$) or an alternative analysis strategy (e.g., $A'$  conditions on $Z$). These design evaluations depend on the model, and so one might reasonably ask how performance would look were the model different (for example if the underlying process involved nonlinearities).





## Relationship to other ways of thinking about research design

[ history of how different fields think about research designs, including beyond political science ]
We build on two influential research design frameworks. [@kkv1994, p. 13] enumerate four components of a research design: a theory, a research question, data, and an approach to using the data. @geddes2003paradigms articulates the links between theory formation, research question formulation, case selection and coding strategies, and strategies for case comparison and inference. In both cases, the set of components are closely aligned to those in the framework we propose.


## Implications

In this book, we are asking that scholars add a new step to their workflow. We want scholars to formally declare and diagnose their research designs both in order to learn about them and to improve them. Much of the work of declaring and diagnosing designs is already part of how social scientists conduct research: grant proposals, IRB protocols, preanalysis plans, and dissertation prospectuses contain design information and justifications for why the design is appropriate for the question. The lack of a common language to describe designs and their properties, however, seriously hampers the utility of these practices for assessing and improving design quality. We hope that the inclusion of a declaration-diagnosis-redesign step to the research process can help address this basic difficulty.

We outline three phases of the scientific process during which the MIDA and declaration-diagnosis-redesign framework can assist study authors, readers, and research funders.

**Making design choices**. The move towards increasing credibility of research in the social sciences places a premium on considering alternative data strategies and analysis strategies at early stages of research projects, not only because it reduces researcher discretion, but more importantly because it can improve the quality of the final research design. While there is nothing new about the idea of determining features such as sampling and estimation strategies ex ante, in practice many designs are finalized late in the research process, after data are collected. Frontloading design decisions is difficult not only because existing tools are rudimentary and often misleading, but because it is not clear in current practice what features of a design must be considered ex ante.

We provide a framework for identifying *which* features affect the assessment of a design's properties, declaring designs and diagnosing their inferential quality, and frontloading design decisions. Declaring the design's features in code enables direct exploration of alternative data and analysis strategies using simulated data; evaluating alternative strategies through diagnosis; and exploring the robustness of a chosen strategy to alternative models. Researchers can undertake each step before study implementation or data collection.

**Communicating design choices**. Bias in published results can arise for many reasons. For example, researchers may deliberately or inadvertently select analysis strategies because they produce statistically significant results. Proposed solutions to reduce this kind of bias focus on various types of preregistration of analysis strategies by researchers [@Rennie2004; @Zarin2008; @Casey2012; @Nosek2015a; @Green2015]. Study registries are now operating in numerous areas of social science, including those hosted by the American Economic Association, Evidence in Governance and Politics, and the Center for Open Science. Bias may also arise from reviewers basing publication recommendations on statistical significance. Results-blind review processes are being introduced in some journals to address this form of bias [e.g. @Findley:2016].

However, the effectiveness of design registries and results-blind review in reducing the scope for either form of publication bias depends on clarity over which elements must be included to describe the design. In practice, some registries rely on checklists and preanalysis plans exhibit great variation, ranging from lists of written hypotheses to all-but-results journal articles. In our view, the solution to this problem does not lie in ever-more-specific questionnaires, but rather in a new way of characterizing designs whose analytic features can be diagnosed through simulation.

The actions to be taken by researchers are described by the data strategy and the answer strategy; these two features of a design are clearly relevant elements of a preregistration document. In order to know which design choices were made ex ante and which were arrived at ex post, researchers need to communicate their data and answer strategies unambiguously. However, assessing whether the data and answer strategies are any good usually requires specifying a model and an inquiry. Design declaration can clarify for researchers and third parties what aspects of a study need to be specified in order to meet standards for effective preregistration. 

Declaration of a design in code also enables a final and infrequently practiced step of the registration process, in which the researcher ``reports and reconciles'' the final with the planned analysis. Identifying how and whether the features of a design diverge between ex ante and ex post declarations highlights deviations from the preanalysis plan. The magnitude of such deviations determines whether results should be considered exploratory or confirmatory. At present, this exercise requires a review of dozens of pages of text, such that differences (or similarities) are not immediately clear even to close readers. Reconciliation of designs declared in code can be conducted automatically, by comparing changes to the code itself (e.g., a move from the use of a stratified sampling function to simple random sampling) and by comparing key variables in the design such as sample sizes.

**Challenging Design Choices.** The independent replication of the results of studies after their publication is an essential component of the shift toward more credible science. Replication --- whether verification, reanalysis of the original data, or reproduction using fresh studies --- provides incentives for researchers to be clear and transparent in their analysis strategies, and can build confidence in findings.^[For a discussion of the distinctions between these different modes of replication, see @Clemens2015.]

In addition to rendering the design more transparent, design declaration can allow for a different approach to the re-analysis and critique of published research. A standard practice for replicators engaging in reanalysis is to propose a range of alternative strategies and assess the robustness of the *data-dependent* estimates to different analyses. The problem with this approach is that, when divergent results are found, third parties do not have clear grounds to decide which results to believe. This issue is compounded by the fact that, in changing the analysis strategy, replicators risk departing from the estimand of the original study, possibly providing different answers to different questions. In the worst case scenario, it can be difficult to determine what is learned both from the original study and from the replication. 

A more coherent strategy facilitated by design simulations would be to use a design declaration to conduct "design replication." In a design replication, a scholar restates the essential design characteristics to learn about what the study *could have* revealed, not just what the original author reports *was* revealed. This helps to answer the question: under what conditions are the results of a study to be believed? By emphasizing abstract properties of the design, design replication provides grounds to support alternative analyses on the basis of the original authors' intentions and not on the basis of the degree of divergence of results. Conversely, it provides authors with grounds to question claims made by their critics. 

## Limitations
Declaring a design is just like writing out a recipe. You *can* cook without writing out a recipe, but when you do, you can think through the whole process start to finish, you can critique the process, and you can modify it. That said, designing high quality research is difficult and comes with many pitfalls, only a subset of which are ameliorated by the *MIDA* framework. Others we fail to address entirely and in some cases, we may even exacerbate them. We outline four concerns.

The first is the worry that evaluative weight could get placed on essentially meaningless diagnoses. Given that design declaration includes declarations of conjectures about the world it is possible to choose inputs so that a design passes any diagnostic test set for it. For instance, a simulation-based claim to unbiasedness that incorporates all features of a design is still only good with respect to the precise conditions of the simulation (in contrast, analytic results, when available, may extend over general classes of designs). Still worse, simulation parameters might be selected because of their properties. A power analysis, for instance,  may be useless if implausible parameters are chosen to raise power artificially. While MIDA may encourage more honest declarations, there is nothing in the framework that enforces them. As ever, garbage-in, garbage-out.

Second, we see a risk that research may get evaluated on the basis of a narrow, but perhaps inappropriate set of diagnosands. Statistical power is often invoked as a key design feature -- but even well-powered studies that are biased away from their targets of interest are of little theoretical use. The appropriateness of the diagnosand depends on the purposes of the study. As MIDA is silent on the question of a study's purpose, it cannot guide researchers or critics to the appropriate set of diagnosands by which to evaluate a design. An advantage of the approach however is that the choice of diagnosands gets highlighted and new diagnosands can be generated in response to substantive concerns.

Third, emphasis on the statistical properties of a design can obscure the substantive importance of a question being answered or other qualitative features of a design. A similar concern has been raised regarding the ``identification revolution'' where a focus on identification risks crowding out attention to the importance of questions being addressed \citep{huber2013}. Our framework can help researchers determine whether a particular design answers a question well (or at all), and it also nudges them to make sure that their questions are defined clearly and \textit{independently of their answer strategies}. It cannot, however, help researchers choose good questions.

Finally, we see a risk that the variation in the suitability of design declaration to different research strategies may be taken as evidence of the relative superiority of different types of research strategies. While we believe that the range of strategies that can be declared and diagnosed is wider than what one might at first think possible, there is no reason to believe that all strong designs can be declared either ex ante or ex post. An advantage of our framework, we hope, is that it can help clarify when a strategy can or cannot be completely declared. When a design cannot be declared, nondeclarability is all the framework provides, and in such cases we urge caution in drawing conclusions about design quality.

*MIDA* captures the analysis-relevant features of a design, but it does not describe substantive elements, such as how theories are derived or interventions are implemented. Yet many other aspects of a design that are not explicitly labeled in these features enter into this framework if they are analytically relevant. For example, logistical details of data collection such as the duration of time between a treatment being administered and endline data collection enter into the model if the longer time until data collection affects subject recall of the treatment. However, information in *MIDA* is typically insufficient to assess those substantive elements, an important and separate part of assessing the quality of a research study.
