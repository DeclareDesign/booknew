<!-- How to use this book -->

With this book, we hope to promote a new, comprehensive way of thinking about research designs in the social sciences. We hope this way of thinking will make research designs more transparent and more robust. But we also hope it will make research design easier: easier to produce good designs, but also easier to share designs and build off of the designs that others have developed.

The core idea is to start to think of a design as an object that can be interrogated. The object has four main charateristics, and we have to understand all four. The design encodes your beliefs about the world, it describes your questions, and it lays out how you go about answering those questions, in terms both of what data you use and how you use it. A key idea is that all of these features can be provided in code and -- if done right -- the information provided is enough to estimate the quality of the design through simulation.

We think this way of thinking about research design pays dividends at every point through the research lifecycle. Choosing a question, synthesizing previous answers, conducting an ethical review, piloting parts of the empirical strategy, crafting a preanlysis plan, implementing the study, summarizing the result, writing the paper, publishing the result, archiving the materials, engaging with critical scholarship -- a clear understanding of research design is immensely value throughout every stage of the process. We think all^* empirical research designs can be described in terms of a model of the world, an inquiry about the world, a data strategy to gather information about the world, and an answer strategy that summarizes that information. If you can articulate those four aspects of the design, every part of the research process becomes clearer, easier, and better for science.

## How to read this book

We had multiple audiences in mind when writing this book. First, we're thinking of college seniors who have to produce a longform research essay. These students need a framework for thinking about the ways each part of the research process fits together. We're also thinking of graduate students in seminar courses where the main purpose of the course is to read papers and discuss how well the theory matches the empirics. The MIDA framework introduced in Part I is a way to structure both activities that accomodates many different empirical approaches -- qualtitative and quantitative, descriptive and causal, observational and experimental. If we only had 30 minutes with a person to try and get them to understand what our book is about -- we would give them part I.

Part II is more involved. In Part II, we provide the mathematical foundation for the MIDA framework. We walk though each component of a research design in detail -- Models, Inquiries, Data strategies, and Answer Strategies. We describe the finer points of research design diagnosis and how to carry out a redesign. We imagine that Part II could be assigned early in a graduate course on research design in any of the social sciences. Part II is where we try and communicate every thing we know about a research design in general.

In part III, we apply the general framework to specific research designs. The result is a library of canonical research designs. Many empirical research designs are included in the library, but not all. The set of entries covers a large portion of what we see in current empirical practice, but it is not meant to be exhaustive. We are thinking of two kinds of audiences for the design library -- the first is the researcher who wants to know how a specific research design operates and what to watch out for. They turn to the Regression Discontinuity entry and immediately learn the ten most important things to know about RD. These 10 most important things are not **everything** there is to know about RD -- for that we refer this first kind of reader to the most up-to-date methodological treatments of the topic. The second reader we have in mind is a person who is studying the entry not to learn the specifics of RD necessarily, but instead to learn to become a research designer. The RD entry is an **instance** of a research design from which general lessons about research design can be drawn. Readers who want to be research designers should read through the design library in its entirety.

The last section of the book describes in detail how our framework can help at each step of the research process. Each of these sections of the book should be readable for anyone who has read part one. The entry on preanalysis plans can be assigned in an experiments course as guidance for students filing their first paps. The entry on research ethics could be shared amongst coauthors at the start of a project. The entry on writing a research paper could be assigned to college seniors trying hard to finish their essay on time. 


## How to **work** this book

At many times throughout the book, we will describe research designs not just in words, but in computer code. You can read all of Part I without any coding, but some aspects of Part II and Part III are enhanced by engaging with the code. 

If you want to work though all of the code and exercises, fantastic. We're here for you. This path requires investment in `R`, the `tidyverse` and the `DeclareDesign` set of software packages. We think it's very rewarding but we understand that there is a learning curve. You could, of course, tackle the declaration, diagnosis, and redesign processes using bespoke simulations in any computer language you like, but it's easier in `DeclareDesign`.

If you want nothing to do with the code, you can skip all the code and exercises to just focus on the text. We've self-consciously written the book so that understanding of the code is not required in order to understand the research design concepts under discussions. If you are choosing this path, we promise our way of thinking about research design is useful even without any code.

The free, online version of this book has many extra ways to engage with the material. You can download any section of code and you can play with interactive simulations. These bells and whistles are not necessary for understanding, but they can help make some of the finer points clearer.

## What this book will not do

This is a research design textbook, not a statistics textbook. We will not derive estimators, we will provide no optimality guarantees, and we will present no proofs.

By the same token -- this is a research design textbook, not a handbook of best practices for all research designs. We can't tell you the best thing to do in your particular research scenarios because we know far far less about your research than you do -- you have to learn for yourself what the most important design considerations will be.

What we do have is language to express research designs. We can help you to learn that language so you can describe your own design in it. When you can declare your design in this language, then you can diagnose it, then improve it through redesign.






<!-- For a researcher, being able to simulate a design puts you in a powerful position as you can then start assessing the conditions under which a design perfoms well or badly. -->

<!-- For a reader, a complete declaration lets you quickly examine the analytic core of a design. As you work through designs in this book we hope you will develop a nose for quickly parsing distinct parts of a design. Seeing what kind of model of the world presupposed by a design, what are the kinds of inquiries you might expect to see, what are the data strategies, what are analysis strategies, and how these all link together. -->
