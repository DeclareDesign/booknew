# Preamble

We introduce a way of thinking about research designs in the social sciences. Our hope is that this approach will make designing research studies easier: making it easier to produce good designs, but also easier to share designs and build on the designs of others.

The core idea is that a design has four main characteristics: a model, an inquiry, a data strategy, and an answer strategy. We have to understand each of the four on their own and also how they interrelate. The design encodes your beliefs about the world, it describes your questions, and it lays out how you go about answering those questions, both in terms of both what data you collect and how you analyze it. In strong designs, choices made in the model and inquiry are reflected in the data and answer strategies, and vice versa.

Designs can be thought of as objects that can be interrogated. Each of the elements of the design can be "declared" in code and -- if done right -- the information provided is enough to "diagnose" the quality of the design through simulation. Researchers can then select the best design for their purposes by "redesigning" over alternative, feasible designs.

This way of thinking about research design pays dividends at multiple points in the research lifecycle: choosing a question, synthesizing previous answers, conducting an ethics review, piloting parts of the empirical strategy, crafting a preanalysis plan, implementing the study, summarizing the results, writing the paper, publishing the result, archiving the materials, informing policy decisions, and contributing to meta-analyses. The declaration, diagnosis, and redesign process informs choices made from the start to the end of a research project.

## How to read this book

We had multiple audiences in mind when writing this book. First, we're thinking of college seniors who have to produce a course research paper. These students need a framework for thinking about the ways each part of the research process fit together. We're also thinking of graduate students in seminar courses where the main purpose of the course is to read papers and discuss how well the theory matches the empirics. The "MIDA" framework introduced in Part I accommodates many different empirical approaches: qualitative and quantitative, descriptive and causal, observational and experimental. If we only had 30 minutes with a person to try and get them to understand what our book is about, we would give them Part I.

Part II is more involved. We provide the mathematical foundations of the MIDA framework. We walk through each component of a research design in detail, describe the finer points of research design diagnosis, and explain how to carry out a redesign. Part II will resonate with several audiences of applied researchers both inside and outside of academia. We imagine it could be assigned early in a graduate course on research design in any of the social sciences. Data scientists and monitoring and evaluation professionals will find value in a framework for learning about research designs. Funders and decisionmakers often wish to assess research not in terms of its results but its design; our ideas provides a way a way of defining the design and diagnosing its quality. Scholars in many research traditions will find value in declaring and diagnosing designs. Dyed-in-the-wool randomistas will find a tool that can assess the implications of changes to sampling, random assignment, measurement, and estimation at once rather than separately. EITM scholars can evaluate the quality of the link between theory and empirics. And mixed methods scholars can assess their designs as a whole, with multiple answer strategies that each link to a different inquiry.

<!-- [non student audiences: Experimenters, applied researchers doing prospective empirical work. Theories interested in using empirical information to distinguish between theoretical models. Many of our ideas will resonate with those who study the "empirical implications of theoretical models."] -->

In Part III, we apply the general framework to specific research designs. The result is a library of common designs. Many empirical research designs are included in the library, but not all. The set of entries covers a large portion of what we see in current empirical practice across social sciences, but it is not meant to be exhaustive. 

We are thinking of three kinds of uses for entries in the design library. Collectively the design entries serve to illustrate the fundamental principles of design. The  entries clarify the variety of ways in which models, inquiries, data strategies, and answer strategies can be connected and show how high level principles operate in common ways across very different designs. The second use is pedagogical. The library entries provide hands on illustrations of designs in action. A researcher interested in understanding the "regression discontinuity design," for example, can quickly see a complete implementation and learn about conditions under which the design performs well or poorly. They can also compare the suitability of one type of design against another for a given problem. We emphasize that these treatments of different designs provide entry points but they are not exhaustive and so we refer at the end of each entry to a set of the most up-to-date methodological treatments of the topic. The third use is as a starter kit to help you get going on a design of your own. Each entry includes code for a basic design that can be used and modified to capture the case you are working with.

The last section of the book describes in detail how our framework can help at each step of the research process. Each of these sections of the book should be readable for anyone who has read Part I. The entry on preanalysis plans can be assigned in an experiments course as guidance for students filing their first preanalysis plan. The entry on research ethics could be shared among coauthors at the start of a project. The entry on writing a research paper could be assigned to college seniors trying to finish their essays on time. 

## How to **work** this book

At many times throughout the book, we will describe research designs not just in words, but in computer code. 
<!-- You can read all of Part I without any coding, but some aspects of Part II and Part III are enhanced by engaging with the code.  -->
If you want to work through all of the code and exercises, fantastic. This path requires investment in `R`, the `tidyverse`, and the `DeclareDesign` software package. Chapter \@ref(primer) helps get you started. We think doing it this way is very rewarding, but we understand that there is a learning curve. You could, of course, tackle the declaration, diagnosis, and redesign processes using bespoke simulations in any computer language you like,^[On our Web site, we provide examples in `R`, Python, Stata, and Excel.] but it is easier in `DeclareDesign`.

If you want nothing to do with the code, you can skip all the code and exercises and just focus on the text. We have written the book so that understanding of the code is not required in order to understand research design concepts. 
<!-- If you choose this path, we promise our way of thinking about research design is useful even without any code. -->

The free, online version of this book has many extra ways to engage with the material. You can download any section of code and you can play with interactive simulations. These bells and whistles are not necessary for understanding, but we all learn in different ways.

## What this book will not do

This is research design book, not a statistics textbook. We will not derive estimators, we will provide no guarantees of the general optimality of designs, and we will present no mathematical proofs. Nor will we provide all the answers to all the practical questions you might have about your design.

What we do offer is a language to express research designs. We can help you learn that language so you can describe your own design in it. When you can declare your design in this language, then you can diagnose it, then improve it through redesign.
