["index.html", "Declaring and Diagnosing Research Designs Chapter 1 Preface", " Declaring and Diagnosing Research Designs Graeme Blair, Jasper Cooper, Alexander Coppock, and Macartan Humphreys Chapter 1 Preface With this book, we hope to promote a new, comprehensive way of thinking about research designs in the social sciences. We hope this way of thinking will make research designs more transparent and more robust. But we also hope it will make research design easier, easier to produce good designs, but also easier to share designs and build off of the designs that others have developed. The core idea is to start think of a design as an object that can be interrogated. The design encodes your beliefs about the world, it describes your questions, and it lays out how you go about answering those questions, in terms both of what data you use and how you use it. A key idea is that all of these features can be provided in code and if done right the information provided is enough to be able to simulate a run of the design and assess its properties. For a researcher, being able to simulate a design puts you in a powerful position as you can then start assessing the conditions under which a design perfoms well or badly. For a reader, a complete declaration lets you quickly examine the analytic core of a design. As you work through designs in this book we hope you will develop a nose for quickly parsing what goes in the model, what are the kinds of inquiries you should expect to see, what are the data strategies, what are analysis strategies, and how these all link together. What this book will not do derive estimators no analytic results no optimality guarantees GIGO "],
["what-is-a-design.html", "Chapter 2 What is a Design?", " Chapter 2 What is a Design? We make heavy use of a fairly general framework for describing the core elements of a research design. The basic idea is a research design is a specification of a problem and a strategy to answer it. We build on two influential frameworks. King, Keohane, and Verba (1994) enumerate four components of a research design: a theory, a research question, data, and an approach to using the data. Geddes (2003) articulates the links between theory formation, research question formulation, case selection and coding strategies, and strategies for case comparison and inference. In both cases the set of steps are closely aligned to those in the framework we propose. In the exposition, we also employ elements from Pearl (2009) approach to structural modeling, which provides a syntax for mapping design inputs to design outputs as well as the potential outcomes framework as presented, for example, in Imbens and Rubin (2015), which many political scientists use to clarify their inferential targets. We characterize the design problem at a high level of generality with the central focus being on the relationship between questions and answer strategies. References "],
["elements-of-a-research-design.html", "2.1 Elements of a Research Design", " 2.1 Elements of a Research Design The specification of a problem requires a description of the world and the question to be asked about the world as described. The answering requires a description of what information is used and how conclusions are reached given the information. At its most basic we think of a research design, \\(\\Delta\\), as including four elements \\(&lt;M,I,D,A&gt;\\): A , \\(M\\), of how the world works. In general following Pearl’s definition of a probabilistic causal model we will assume that a model contains three core elements. First, a specification of the variables \\(X\\) about which research is being conducted. This includes endogenous and exogenous variables (\\(V\\) and \\(U\\) respectively) and the ranges of these variables. In the formal literature this is sometimes called the of a model (Halpern 2000). Second, a specification of how each endogenous variable depends on other variables (the functional relations'' or, as in @Imbens2015,potential outcomes’’), \\(F\\). Third, a probability distribution over exogenous variables, \\(P(U)\\). An , \\(I\\), about the distribution of variables, \\(X\\), perhaps given interventions on some variables. Using Pearl’s notation we can distinguish between questions that ask about the conditional values of variables, such as \\(\\Pr(X_1 | X_2 =1)\\) and questions that ask about values that would arise under interventions: \\(\\Pr(X_1 | do(X_2 = 1))\\). We let \\(a^M\\) denote the answer to \\(I\\) . Conditional on the model, \\(a^M\\) is the value of the estimand, the quantity that the researcher wants to learn about. A strategy, \\(D\\), generates data \\(d\\) on \\(X\\). Data \\(d\\) arises, under model \\(M\\) with probability \\(P_M(d|D)\\). The data strategy includes sampling strategies and assignment strategies, which we denote with \\(P_S\\) and \\(P_Z\\) respectively. Measurement techniques are also a part of data strategies and can be thought of as a selection of observable variables that carry information about unobservable variables. An answer strategy, \\(A\\), that generates answer \\(a^A\\) using data \\(d\\). A key feature of this bare specification is that if \\(M\\), \\(D\\), and \\(A\\) are sufficiently well described, the answer to question \\(I\\) has a distribution \\(P_M(a^A|D)\\). Moreover, one can construct a distribution of comparisons of this answer to the correct answer, under \\(M\\), for example by assessing \\(P_M(a^M-a^A|D)\\). One can also compare this to results under different data or analysis strategies, \\(P_M(a^M-a^A|D&#39;)\\) and \\(P_M(a^M-a^{A&#39;}|D)\\), and to answers generated under alternative models, \\(P_M(a^{M&#39;}-a^{A}|D)\\), as long as these possess signatures that are consistent with inquiries and answer strategies. MIDA captures the analysis-relevant features of a design, but it does not describe substantive elements, such as how theories are derived or interventions are implemented. Yet many other aspects of a design that are not explicitly labeled in these features enter into this framework if they are analytically relevant. For example, logistical details of data collection such as the duration of time between a treatment being administered and endline data collection enter into the model if the longer time until data collection affects subject recall of the treatment. However, information in {} is typically insufficient to assess those substantive elements, an important and separate part of assessing the quality of a research study. References "],
["using-diagnosands-to-evaluate-a-design.html", "2.2 Using diagnosands to evaluate a design", " 2.2 Using diagnosands to evaluate a design The ability to calculate distributions of answers, given a model, opens multiple avenues for assessment and critique. How good is the answer you expect to get from a given strategy? Would you do better, given some desideratum, with a different data strategy? With a different analysis strategy? How good is the strategy if the model is wrong in some way or another? To allow for this kind of diagnosis of a design, we introduce two further concepts, both functions of research designs. These are quantities that a researcher or a third party could calculate with respect to a design. A {} is a summary statistic generated from a “run” of a design—that is, the results given a possible realization of variables, given the model and data strategy. A diagnostic statistic may or may not depend on the model as well as realized data. For example the statistic: \\(e=\\) “difference between the estimated and the actual average treatment effect” depends on the model (since the ATE depends on the model’s assumptions about potential outcomes). The statistic \\(s = \\mathbb{1}(p \\leq 0.05)\\), interpreted as “the result is considered statistically significant at the 5% level”,’’ does not depend on the model but it does presuppose an answer strategy that reports a \\(p\\) value. Diagnostic statistics are governed by probability distributions that arise because both the model and the data generation, given the model, may be stochastic. A Diagnosand is a summary of the distribution of a diagnostic statistic. For example, (expected) in the estimated treatment effect is \\(\\mathbb{E}(e)\\) and statistical is \\(\\mathbb{E}(s)\\). To illustrate, consider the following design. A model M specifies three variables \\(X\\), \\(Y\\) and \\(Z\\) (all defined on the reals). These form the signature. In additional we assume functional relationships between them that allow for the possibility of confounding (for example, \\(Y = bX + Z + \\epsilon_Y; X = Z+ \\epsilon_X\\), with \\(Z, \\epsilon_X, \\epsilon_Z\\) distributed standard normal). The inquiry \\(I\\) is ``what would be the average effect of a unit increase in \\(X\\) on \\(Y\\) in the population?’’ Note that this question depends on the signature of the model, but not the functional equations of the model (the answer provided by the model does of course depend on the functional equations). Consider now a data strategy, \\(D\\), in which data is gathered on \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\) for \\(n\\) randomly selected units. An answer \\(a^A\\), is then generated using ordinary least squares as the answer strategy, \\(A\\). We have specified all the components of MIDA. We now ask: How strong is this research design? One way to answer this question is with respect to the diagnosand “expected error.” Here the model’s functional equations provide an answer, \\(a^M\\) to the inquiry (for any draw of \\(\\beta\\)), and so the distribution of the expected error, given the model, \\(a^A-a^M\\), can be calculated. In this example the expected performance of the design may be poor, as measured by this diagnosand, because the data and analysis strategy do not handle the confounding described by the model. In comparison, better performance may be achieved through an alternative data strategy (e.g., where \\(D&#39;\\) randomly assigned \\(X\\) to \\(n\\) units before recording \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\)) or an alternative analysis strategy (e.g., \\(A&#39;\\) conditions on \\(Z\\)). These design evaluations depend on the model, and so one might reasonably ask how performance would look were the model different (for example if the underlying process involved nonlinearities). In all cases, the evaluation of a design depends on the assessment of a diagnosand, and comparing the diagnoses to what could be achieved under alternative designs. In section X we discuss possible choices of diagnosands and operate a set of these "],
["what-is-a-complete-design-declaration.html", "2.3 What is a Complete Design Declaration?", " 2.3 What is a Complete Design Declaration? A declaration of a research design that is in some sense complete is required in order to implement it, communicate its essential features, and to assess its properties. Yet existing definitions make clear that there is no single conception of a complete research design: the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) Statement widely used in medicine includes 22 features and other proposals range from nine to 60 components. We propose a conditional notion of completeness: we say a design is ``diagnosand-complete’’ for a given diagnosand if that diagnosand can be calculated from the declared design. Thus a design that is diagnosand complete for one diagnosand may not be for another. Consider for example the diagnosand statistical power. Power is the probability that a p-value is lower than a critical value. Thus, power-completeness requires that the answer strategy return a p value. It does not, however, require a well-defined estimand. In contrast, Bias- or RMSE-completeness does not require a hypothesis test, but does require the specification of an estimand. Diagnosand-completeness is a desirable property to the extent that it means a diagnosand can be calculated. How useful this is depends however on how useful the diagnosand is for decision making. Thus evaluating completeness should focus first on whether diagnosands for which completeness holds are indeed useful ones. This usefulness depends in part on whether the information on which diagnoses are made is believable. A design may be bias-complete for instance under the assumptions of a particular spillover structure, for example. Readers may disagree with these assumptions but there are still gains from the declaration as the grounds for claims for unbiasedness are clear and the effects of deviations from model assumptions can be assessed. In practice, different research communities set different standards for what constitutes sufficient information to make such conjectures about the world plausible. "],

["simple-random-sampling-1.html", "4.1 Simple Random Sampling", " 4.1 Simple Random Sampling Often we are interested in features of a population, but data on the entire population is prohibitively expensive to collect. Instead, researchers obtain data on a small fraction of the population and use measurements taken on that sample to draw inferences about the population. Imagine we seek to estimate the average political ideology of residents of the small town of Portola, California, on a left-right scale that varies from 1 (most liberal) to 7 (most conservative). We draw a simple random sample in which all residents have an equal chance of inclusion in the study. It’s a straightforward design but formally declaring it will make it easy to assess its properties. 4.1.1 Design Declaration Model: Even for this most basic of designs, researchers bring to bear a background model of the world. As described in Chapter 1, the three elements of a model are the signature, probability distributions over variables, and functional equations among variables. The signature here is a specification of the variable of interest, \\(Y\\), with a well defined domain (seven possible values between 1 and 7). In the code declaration below, we assume a uniform distribution over these 7 values. This choice is a speculation about the population distribution of \\(Y\\); some features of the design diagnosis will depend on the choice of distribution. The functional equations seem absent here as there is only one variable in the model. We could consider an elaboration of the model that includes three variables: the true outcome, \\(Y\\); the decision to measure the outcome, \\(M\\); and the measured outcome, \\(Y^M\\). We ignore this complication for now under the assumption that \\(Y = Y^M\\), i.e., that \\(Y\\) is measured perfectly. Finally, the model also includes information about the size of the population. Portola, California, has a population of approximately 2100 people as of 2010, so \\(N = 2100\\). Inquiry: Our inquiry is the population mean of \\(Y\\): \\(\\frac{1}{N} \\sum_1^N Y_i = \\bar{Y}\\). Data strategy: In simple random sampling, we draw a random sample without replacement of size \\(n\\), where every member of the population has an equal probability of inclusion in the sample, \\(\\frac{n}{N}\\). When \\(N\\) is very large relative to \\(n\\), units are drawn approximately independently. In this design we measure \\(Y\\) for \\(n=100\\) units in the sample; the other \\(N-n\\) units are not measured. Answer strategy: We estimate the population mean with the sample mean estimator: \\(\\widehat{\\overline{Y}} = \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_1^n Y_i\\). Even though our inquiry implies our answer should be a single number, an answer strategy typically also provides statistics that help us assess the uncertainty around that single number. To construct a 95% confidence interval around our estimate, we calculate the standard error of the sample mean, then approximate the sampling distribution of the sample mean estimator using a formula that includes a finite population correction. In particular, we approximate the estimated sampling distribution by a \\(t\\) distribution with \\(n - 1\\) degrees of freedom. In the code for our answer strategy, we spell out each step in turn. # Model ------------------------------------------------------------------- N &lt;- 2100 fixed_population &lt;- declare_population(N = N, Y = sample(1:7, N, replace = TRUE))() population &lt;- declare_population(data = fixed_population) # Inquiry ----------------------------------------------------------------- estimand &lt;- declare_estimand(Ybar = mean(Y)) # Data Strategy ----------------------------------------------------------- n &lt;- 100 sampling &lt;- declare_sampling(n = n) # Answer Strategy --------------------------------------------------------- estimator &lt;- declare_estimator(Y ~ 1, model = lm_robust, estimand = estimand, label = &quot;Sample Mean Estimator&quot;) # Design ------------------------------------------------------------------ design &lt;- population + estimand + sampling + estimator diagnosands &lt;- declare_diagnosands(select = c(bias, coverage, mean_estimate, sd_estimate)) 4.1.2 Takeaways With the design declared we can run a diagnosis and plot results from Monte Carlo simulations of the design: diagnosis &lt;- diagnose_design( design, sims = sims, bootstrap_sims = b_sims, diagnosands = diagnosands) The diagnosis indicates that under simple random sampling, the sample mean estimator of the population mean is unbiased. The graph on the left shows the sampling distribution of the estimator: it’s centered directly on the true value of the inquiry. Confidence intervals also have a sampling distribution – they change depending on the idiosyncrasies of each sample we happen to draw. The figure on the right shows that the 95% of the time the confidence intervals cover the true value of the estimand, as they should. As sample size grows, the sampling distribution of the estimator gets tighter, but the coverage of the confidence intervals stays at 95% – just the properties we would want out of our answer strategy. Things work well here it seems. In the exercises we suggest some small modifications of the design that point to conditions under which things might break down. 4.1.3 Exercises Modify the declaration to change the distribution of \\(Y\\) from being uniform to something else: perhaps imagine that more extreme ideologies are more prevalent than moderate ones. Is the sample mean estimator still unbiased? Interpret your answer. Change the sampling procedure to favor units with higher values of ideology. Is the sample mean estimator still unbiased? Interpret your answer. Modify the estimation function to use this formula for the standard error: \\(\\widehat{se} \\equiv \\frac{\\widehat\\sigma}{\\sqrt{n}}\\). This equation differs from the one used in our declaration (it ignores the total population size \\(N\\)). Check that the coverage of this new design is incorrect when \\(N=n\\). Assess how large \\(N\\) has to be for the difference between these procedures not to matter. 4.1.4 Design Inspector "],

["list-experiments.html", "5.2 List Experiments", " 5.2 List Experiments Sometimes, subjects might not tell the truth when asked about certain attitudes or behaviors. Responses may be affected by sensitivity bias, or the tendancy of survey subjects to dissemble for fear of negative repercussions if some reference group learns their true response (Blair, Coppock, and Moor 2018). In such cases, standard survey estimates based on direct questions will be biased. One class of solutions to this problem is to obscure individual responses, providing protection from social or legal pressures. When we obscure responses systematically through an experiment, we can often still identify average quantities of interest. One such design is the list experiment (introduced by Miller (1984)), which asks respondents for the count of the number of `yes’ responses to a series of questions including the sensitive item, rather than for a yes or no answer on the sensitive item itself. List experiments give subjects cover by aggregating their answer to the sensitive item with responses to other questions. During the 2016 Presidential Election in the U.S., some observers were concerned that pre-election estimates of support for Donald Trump might have been downwardly biased by “Shy Trump Supporters” – survey respondents who supported Trump in their hearts, but were embarrased to admit it to pollsters. To assess this possibility, Coppock (2017) obtained estimates of Trump support that were free of social desirability bias using a list experiment. Subjects in the control and treatment groups were asked: “Here is a list of [three/four] things that some people would do and some people would not. Please tell me HOW MANY of them you would do. We do not want to know which ones of these you would do, just how many. Here are the [three/four] things:” Control Treatment If it were up for a vote, I would vote to raise the minimum wage to 15 dollars an hour If it were up for a vote, I would vote to raise the minimum wage to 15 dollars an hour If it were up for a vote, I would vote to repeal the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare If it were up for a vote, I would vote to repeal the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare If it were up for a vote, I would vote to ban assault weapons If it were up for a vote, I would vote to ban assault weapons If the 2016 presidential election were being held today and the candidates were Hillary Clinton (Democrat) and Donald Trump (Republican), I would vote for Donald Trump. The treatment group averaged 1.843 items while the control group averaged 1.548 items, for a difference-in-means estimate of support for Donald Trump of 29.6% (note that this estimate is representative of US adults and not of US adults who would actually vote). The trouble with this estimate is that, while it’s plausibly free from social desirability bias, it’s also much higher variance. The 95% confidence interval for the list experiment estimate is nearly 14 percentage points wide, whereas the the 95% confidence interval for the (possibly biased!) direct question asked of the same sample is closer to 4 percentage points. The choice between list experiments and direct question is therefore a bias-variance tradeoff. List experiments may have less bias, but they are higher variance. Direct questions may be biased, but they have less variance. 5.2.1 List experiments Model: Our model includes subjects’ true support for Donald Trump and whether or not they are “shy”. These two variables combine to determine how subjects will respond when asked directly about Trump support. The potential outcomes model combines three types of information to determine how subjects will respond to the list experiment: their responses to the three nonsensitive control items, their true support for Trump, and whether they are assigned to see the treatment or the control list. Notice that our definition of the potential outcomes embeds the “No Liars” and “No Design Effects” assumptions required for the list experiment design (see Blair and Imai 2012 for more on these assumptions). We also have a global parameter that reflects our expectations about the proportion of Trump supporters who are shy. It’s set at 6%, which is large enough to make a difference for polling, but not so large as to be implausible. Inquiry: Our estimand is the proportion of voters who actually plan to vote for Trump. Data strategy: First we sample 500 respondents from the U.S. population at random, then we randomly assign 250 of the 500 to treatment and the remainder to control. In the survey, we ask subjects both the direct question and the list experiment question. Answer strategy: We estimate the proportion of truthful Trump voters in two ways. First, we take the mean of answers to the direct question. Second, we take the difference in means in the responses to the list experiment question. # Model ------------------------------------------------------------------- proportion_shy &lt;- .06 list_design &lt;- # Model declare_population( N = 5000, # true trump vote (unobservable) truthful_trump_vote = draw_binary(.45, N), # shy voter (unobservable) shy = draw_binary(proportion_shy, N), # Direct question response (1 if Trump supporter and not shy, 0 otherwise) Y_direct = as.numeric(truthful_trump_vote == 1 &amp; shy == 0), # Nonsensitive list experiment items raise_minimum_wage = draw_binary(.8, N), repeal_obamacare = draw_binary(.6, N), ban_assault_weapons = draw_binary(.5, N) ) + declare_potential_outcomes( Y_list_Z_0 = raise_minimum_wage + repeal_obamacare + ban_assault_weapons, Y_list_Z_1 = Y_list_Z_0 + truthful_trump_vote ) + # Inquiry declare_estimand(proportion_truthful_trump_vote = mean(truthful_trump_vote)) + # Data Strategy declare_sampling(n = 500) + declare_assignment(prob = .5) + declare_reveal(Y_list) + # Answer Strategy declare_estimator( Y_direct ~ 1, model = lm_robust, term = &quot;(Intercept)&quot;, estimand = &quot;proportion_truthful_trump_vote&quot;, label = &quot;direct&quot; ) + declare_estimator( Y_list ~ Z, model = difference_in_means, estimand = &quot;proportion_truthful_trump_vote&quot;, label = &quot;list&quot;) simulations_list &lt;- simulate_design(list_design, sims = sims) The plot shows the sampling distribution of the direct and list experimetn estimators. The sampling distribution of the direct question is tight but biased; the list experiment (if the requisite assumptions hold) is unbiased, but higher variance. The choice between these two estimators of the prevalence rate depends on which – bias or variance – is more important in a particular setting. See Blair, Coppock, and Moor (2018) for an extended discussion of how the choice of research design depends deeply on the purpose of the project. 5.2.2 Randomized response technique References "],

["regression-discontinuity.html", "7.3 Regression Discontinuity", " 7.3 Regression Discontinuity Regression discontinuity designs exploit substantive knowledge that treatment is assigned in a particular way: everyone above a threshold is assigned to treatment and everyone below it is not. Even though researchers do not control the assignment, substantive knowledge about the threshold serves as a basis for a strong identification claim. Thistlewhite and Campbell introduced the regression discontinuity design in the 1960s to study the impact of scholarships on academic success. Their insight was that students with a test score just above a scholarship cutoff were plausibly comparable to students whose scores were just below the cutoff, so any differences in future academic success could be attributed to the scholarship itself. Regression discontinuity designs identify a local average treatment effect: the average effect of treatment exactly at the cutoff. The main trouble with the design is that there is vanishingly little data exactly at the cutoff, so any answer strategy needs to use data that is some distance away from the cutoff. The further away from the cutoff we move, the larger the threat of bias. We’ll consider an application of the regression discontinuity design that examines party incumbency advantage – the effect of a party winning an election on its vote margin in the next election. 7.3.1 Design Declaration Model: Regression discontinuity designs have four components: A running variable, a cutoff, a treatment variable, and an outcome. The cutoff determines which units are treated depending on the value of the running variable. In our example, the running variable \\(X\\) is the Democratic party’s margin of victory at time \\(t-1\\); and the treatment, \\(Z\\), is whether the Democratic party won the election in time \\(t-1\\). The outcome, \\(Y\\), is the Democratic vote margin at time \\(t\\). We’ll consider a population of 1,000 of these pairs of elections. A major assumption required for regression discontinuity is that the conditional expectation functions for both treatment and control potential outcomes are continuous at the cutoff.1 To satisfy this assumption, we specify two smooth conditional expectation functions, one for each potential outcome. The figure plots \\(Y\\) (the Democratic vote margin at time \\(t\\)) against \\(X\\) (the margin at time \\(t-1\\)). We’ve also plotted the true conditional expectation functions for the treated and control potential outcomes. The solid lines correspond to the observed data and the dashed lines correspond to the unobserved data. Inquiry: Our estimand is the effect of a Democratic win in an election on the Democratic vote margin of the next election, when the Democratic vote margin of the first election is zero. Formally, it is the difference in the conditional expectation functions of the control and treatment potential outcomes when the running variable is exactly zero. The black vertical line in the plot shows this difference. Data strategy: We collect data on the Democratic vote share at time \\(t-1\\) and time \\(t\\) for all 1,000 pairs of elections. There is no sampling or random assignment. Answer strategy: We will approximate the treated and untreated conditional expectation functions to the left and right of the cutoff using a flexible regression specification estimated via OLS. In particular, we fit each regression using a fourth-order polynomial. Much of the literature on regression discontinuity designs focuses on the tradeoffs among answer strategies, with many analysts recommending against higher-order polynomial regression specifications. We use one here to highlight how well such an answer strategy does when it matches the functional form in the model. We discuss alternative estimators in the exercises. # Model ------------------------------------------------------------------- cutoff &lt;- 0.5 control &lt;- function(X) { as.vector(poly(X, 4, raw = T) %*% c(.7, -.8, .5, 1))} treatment &lt;- function(X) { as.vector(poly(X, 4, raw = T) %*% c(0, -1.5, .5, .8)) + .15} population &lt;- declare_population( N = 1000, X = runif(N,0,1) - cutoff, noise = rnorm(N,0,.1), Z = 1 * (X &gt; 0) ) potential_outcomes &lt;- declare_potential_outcomes( Y_Z_0 = control(X) + noise, Y_Z_1 = treatment(X) + noise) # Inquiry ----------------------------------------------------------------- estimand &lt;- declare_estimand(LATE = treatment(0) - control(0)) # Answer Strategy --------------------------------------------------------- estimator &lt;- declare_estimator( formula = Y ~ poly(X, 4) * Z, model = lm_robust, estimand = estimand) # Design ------------------------------------------------------------------ design &lt;- population + potential_outcomes + estimand + reveal_outcomes + estimator 7.3.2 Takeaways diagnosis &lt;- diagnose_design(rd_design, sims = sims, bootstrap_sims = b_sims) We highlight three takeaways. First, the power of this design is very low: with 1,000 units we do not achieve even 10% statistical power. However, our estimates of the uncertainty are not too wide: the coverage probability indicates that our confidence intervals indeed contain the estimand 95% of the time as they should. Our answer strategy is highly uncertain because the fourth-order polynomial specification in regression model gives weights to the data that greatly increase the variance of the estimator (Gelman and Imbens (2017)). In the exercises we explore alternative answer strategies that perform better. Second, the design is biased because polynomial approximations of the average effect at exactly the point of the threshold will be inaccurate in small samples (Sekhon and Titiunik (2017)), especially as units farther away from the cutoff are incorporated into the answer strategy. We know that the estimated bias is not due to simulation error by examining the bootstrapped standard error of the bias estimates. Finally, from the figure, we can see how poorly the average effect at the threshold approximates the average effect for all units. The average treatment effect among the treated (to the right of the threshold in the figure) is negative, whereas at the threshold it is positive. This clarifies that the estimand of the regression discontinuity design, the difference at the cutoff, is only relevant for a small – and possibly empty – set of units very close to the cutoff. 7.3.3 Further Reading Since its rediscovery by social scientists in the late 1990s, the regression discontinuity design has been widely used to study diverse causal effects such as: prison on recidivism (Mitchell et al. (2017)); China’s one child policy on human capital (Qin, Zhuang, and Yang (2017)); eligibility for World Bank loans on political liberalization (Carnegie and Samii (2017)); and anti-discrimination laws on minority employment (Hahn, Todd, and Van der Klaauw (1999)). We’ve discussed a “sharp” regression discontinuity design in which all units above the threshold were treated and all units below were untreated. In fuzzy regression discontinuity designs, some units above the cutoff remain untreated or some units below take treatment. This setting is analogous to experiments that experience noncompliance and may require instrumental variables approaches to the answer strategy (see Compliance is a Potential Outcome). Geographic regression discontinuity designs use distance to a border as the running variable: units on one side of the border are treated and units on the other are untreated. Keele and Titiunik (2016) use such a design to study whether voters are more likely to turn out when they have the opportunity to vote directly on legislation on so-called ballot initiatives. A complication of this design is how to measure distance to the border in two dimensions. 7.3.4 Exercises Gelman and Imbens (2017) point out that higher order polynomial regression specifications lead to extreme regression weights. One approach to obtaining better estimates is to select a bandwidth, \\(h\\), around the cutoff, and run a linear regression. Declare a sampling procedure that subsets the data to a bandwidth around the threshold, as well as a first order linear regression specification, and analyze how the power, bias, RMSE, and coverage of the design vary as a function of the bandwidth. The rdrobust estimator in the rdrobust package implements a local polynomial estimator that automatically selects a bandwidth for the RD analysis and bias-corrected confidence intervals. Declare another estimator using the rdrobust function and add it to the design. How does the coverage and bias of this estimator compare to the regression approaches declared above? Reduce the number of polynomial terms of the the treatment() and control() functions and assess how the bias of the design changes as the potential outcomes become increasingly linear as a function of the running variable. Redefine the population function so that units with higher potential outcome are more likely to locate just above the cutoff than below it. Assess whether and how this affects the bias of the design. 7.3.5 Design Inspector References "],

Interestingly, we can sometimes get quite far along a research path without being conscious that the questions we ask do not have answers and the answers we get are answering different questions. Fortunately, computers complain when they are asked to answer badly posted questions. How could a question not have an answer? Answerless questions can arise when inquiries depend on variables that do not exist or are undefined for some units. Consider an audit experiment that seeks to assess the effects of an email from a Latino name (versus a White name) on whether and how well election officials respond to requests for information. For example, do they use a positive or negative tone. These questions seem reasonable enough. The problem, however, is that if there are officials who don’t send responses, tone is undefined. More subtly, if there is an official that does send an email but would not have sent it in a different treatment condition, then tone is undefined for one of their potential outcomes. 10.1.1 A design with sometimes undefined outcomes Here are the key parts to the design: Model: The model has two outcome variables, \\(R_i\\) and \\(Y_i\\). \\(R_i\\) stands for “response” and is equal to 1 if a response is sent, and 0 otherwise. \\(Y_i\\) is the tone of the response and is normally distributed when it is defined. \\(Z_i\\) is the treatment and equals 1 if the email is sent using a Latino name and 0 otherwise. The table below shows the potential outcomes for four possible types of subjects, depending on the potential outcomes of \\(R_i\\). A types respond if and only if they are not treated B types respond if and only if they are treated C types never respond, regardless of treatment D types always respond regardless of treatment The table also includes columns for the potential outcomes of \\(Y_i\\), showing which potential outcome subjects would express depending on their type. The key thing to note is that for the A, B, and C types, the effect of treatment on \\(Y_i\\) is undefined because messages never sent have no tone. The last (and very important) feature of our model is that the outcomes \\(Y_i\\) are possibly correlated with subject type. Even though both \\(E[Y_i(1) | \\text{Type} = D]\\) and \\(E[Y_i(1) | \\text{Type} = B]\\) exist, there’s no reason to expect that they are the same. Causal Types Type \\(R_i(0)\\) \\(R_i(1)\\) \\(E(Y_i(0))\\) \\(E(Y_i(1))\\) A 1 0 -1 NA B 0 1 NA -1 C 0 0 NA NA D 1 1 0 1 Inquiry: We have two inquiries. The first is straightforward: \\(E[R_i(1) - R_i(0)]\\) is the Average Treatment Effect on response. The second inquiry is the undefined inquiry that does not have an answer: \\(E[Y_i(1) - Y_i(0)]\\). We will also consider a third inquiry, which is defined: \\(E[Y_i(1) - Y_i(0) | \\mathrm{Type} = D]\\), which is the average effect of treatment on tone among \\(D\\) types. Data strategy: The data strategy will be to use complete random assignment to assign 250 of 500 units to treatment. Answer strategy: We’ll try to answer all three inquiries with the difference-in-means estimator. This design can be declared formally like this: # Model ------------------------------------------------------------------- population &lt;- declare_population( N = 500, noise = rnorm(N), type = sample(1:4, N, replace = TRUE, prob = c(0, 1/3, 1/3, 1/3)), A = type == 1, B = type == 2, C = type == 3, D = type == 4) pos &lt;- declare_potential_outcomes( R_Z_0 = A|D, # A and D types report in the control condition R_Z_1 = B|D, # B and D types report in the treatment condition Y_Z_0 = ifelse(R_Z_0, 0*D - 1*A + noise, NA), Y_Z_1 = ifelse(R_Z_1, 1*D - 1*B + noise, NA)) # Inquiry ----------------------------------------------------------------- estimands &lt;- declare_estimand( ATE_R = mean(R_Z_1 - R_Z_0), ATE_Y = mean(Y_Z_1 - Y_Z_0), ATE_Y_for_Ds = mean(Y_Z_1[D] - Y_Z_0[D])) # Data Strategy ----------------------------------------------------------- assignment &lt;- declare_assignment() reveal &lt;- declare_reveal(outcome_variables = c(&quot;R&quot;, &quot;Y&quot;)) # Answer Strategy --------------------------------------------------------- est1 &lt;- declare_estimator(R ~ Z, estimand = &quot;ATE_R&quot;, label = &quot;DIM_R&quot;) est2 &lt;- declare_estimator(Y ~ Z, estimand = list(&quot;ATE_Y&quot;, &quot;ATE_Y_for_Ds&quot;), label = &quot;DIM_Y&quot;) # Design ------------------------------------------------------------------ design &lt;- population + pos + estimands + assignment + reveal + est1 + est2 10.1.2 What we find from diagnosis Here is a diagnosis of this design: diagnosis &lt;- diagnose_design(design, sims = sims, bootstrap_sims = b_sims) Design Label Estimator Label Term N Sims Bias RMSE Power Coverage Mean Estimate SD Estimate Mean Se Type S Rate Mean Estimand design DIM_R Z 1000 0.00 0.04 1.00 0.98 0.33 0.04 0.04 0.00 0.33 (0.00) (0.00) (0.00) (0.00) (0.00) (0.00) (0.00) (0.00) (0.00) design DIM_Y Z 1000 NA NA 0.05 NA 0.00 0.15 0.16 NA NA NA NA (0.01) NA (0.00) (0.00) (0.00) NA NA design DIM_Y Z 1000 -1.00 1.01 0.05 0.00 0.00 0.15 0.16 0.57 1.00 (0.00) (0.00) (0.01) (0.00) (0.00) (0.00) (0.00) (0.07) (0.00) We learn three things from the design diagnosis. First, as expected, our experiment is unbiased for the average treatment effect on response. Second, our second inquiry, as well as our diagnostics for it, are undefined. The diagnosis tells us that our definition of potential outcomes produces a definition problem for the estimand. Note that some diagnosands are defined, including power. These are diagnosands that depend only on the answer strategy and not on the estimand. The third estimand – the average effects for the \\(D\\) types – is defined but our estimates are biased. The reason for this is that we cannot tell from the data which types are the \\(D\\) types: we are not conditioning on the correct subset. Indeed, we are unable to condition on the correct subset. If a subject responds in the treatment group, we don’t know if she is an \\(B\\) or a \\(D\\) type; in the control group, we can’t tell if a responder is an \\(A\\) or a \\(D\\) type. Our difference-in-means estimator of the ATE on \\(Y\\) among \\(D\\)s will be off whenever \\(D\\)s have different outcomes from \\(A\\)s and \\(B\\)s. There are some solutions to this problem. In some cases, the problem might be resolved by changing the inquiry. Closely related estimands can often be defined, perhaps by redefining \\(Y\\) (e.g., emails never sent have a tone of zero). Some redefinitions of the problem, as in the one we examine above, require estimating effects for unobserved subgroups which is a difficult challenge. 10.1.3 Other instances of this problem This kind of problem is surprisingly common. Here are three more instances of the problem: \\(Y\\) is the decision to vote Democrat (\\(Y=1\\)) or Republican (\\(Y=0\\)), \\(R\\) is the decision to turn out to vote and \\(Z\\) is a campaign message. The decision to vote may depend on treatment but if subjects do not vote then \\(Y\\) is undefined. \\(Y\\) is the weight of infants, \\(R\\) is whether a child is born and \\(Z\\) is a maternal health intervention. Fertility may depend on treatment but the weight of unborn (possibly never conceived) babies is not defined. \\(Y\\) is the charity to whom contributions are made during fundraising and \\(R\\) is whether anything is contributed and \\(Z\\) is an encouragement to contribute. The identity of beneficiaries is not defined if there are no contributions. All of these problem exhibit a form of post treatment bias (see section Post treatment bias) but the issue goes beyond picking the right estimator. Our problem here is conceptual: the effect of treatment on the outcome just doesn’t exist for some subjects. 10.1.4 Keep thinking Some puzzles: The amount of bias on the third estimand depends on both the distribution of types and the correlation of types with the potential outcomes of Y. Modify the declaration so that the estimator of the effect on Y is unbiased, changing only the distribution of types. Repeat the exercise, changing only the relation between the types and the potential outcomes of \\(Y\\). Try approaching the problem by redefining the inquiry, seeking to assess the effect of treatment on the share of responses with positive tone. "],
