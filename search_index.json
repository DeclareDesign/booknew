["preamble.html", "Chapter 1 Preamble", " Chapter 1 Preamble With this book, we hope to promote a new, comprehensive way of thinking about research designs in the social sciences. We hope this way of thinking will make research designs more transparent and more robust. But we also hope it will make research design easier: easier to produce good designs, but also easier to share designs and build off of the designs that others have developed. The core idea is to start to think of a design as an object that can be interrogated. The object has four main charateristics, and we have to understand all four. The design encodes your beliefs about the world, it describes your questions, and it lays out how you go about answering those questions, in terms both of what data you use and how you use it. A key idea is that all of these features can be provided in code and – if done right – the information provided is enough to estimate the quality of the design through simulation. We think this way of thinking about research design pays dividends at every point through the research lifecycle. Choosing a question, synthesizing previous answers, conducting an ethical review, piloting parts of the empirical strategy, crafting a preanlysis plan, implementing the study, summarizing the result, writing the paper, publishing the result, archiving the materials, engaging with critical scholarship – a clear understanding of research design is immensely value throughout every stage of the process. We think all^* empirical research designs can be described in terms of a model of the world, an inquiry about the world, a data strategy to gather information about the world, and an answer strategy that summarizes that information. If you can articulate those four aspects of the design, every part of the research process becomes clearer, easier, and better for science. "],
["how-to-read-this-book.html", "1.1 How to read this book", " 1.1 How to read this book We had multiple audiences in mind when writing this book. First, we’re thinking of college seniors who have to produce a longform research essay. These students need a framework for thinking about the ways each part of the research process fits together. We’re also thinking of graduate students in seminar courses where the main purpose of the course is to read papers and discuss how well the theory matches the empirics. The MIDA framework introduced in Part I is a way to structure both activities that accomodates many different empirical approaches – qualtitative and quantitative, descriptive and causal, observational and experimental. If we only had 30 minutes with a person to try and get them to understand what our book is about – we would give them part I. Part II is more involved. In Part II, we provide the mathematical foundation for the MIDA framework. We walk though each component of a research design in detail – Models, Inquiries, Data strategies, and Answer Strategies. We describe the finer points of research design diagnosis and how to carry out a redesign. We imagine that Part II could be assigned early in a graduate course on research design in any of the social sciences. Part II is where we try and communicate every thing we know about a research design in general. In part III, we apply the general framework to specific research designs. The result is a library of canonical research designs. Many empirical research designs are included in the library, but not all. The set of entries covers a large portion of what we see in current empirical practice, but it is not meant to be exhaustive. We are thinking of two kinds of audiences for the design library – the first is the researcher who wants to know how a specific research design operates and what to watch out for. They turn to the Regression Discontinuity entry and immediately learn the ten most important things to know about RD. These 10 most important things are not everything there is to know about RD – for that we refer this first kind of reader to the most up-to-date methodological treatments of the topic. The second reader we have in mind is a person who is studying the entry not to learn the specifics of RD necessarily, but instead to learn to become a research designer. The RD entry is an instance of a research design from which general lessons about research design can be drawn. Readers who want to be research designers should read through the design library in its entirety. The last section of the book describes in detail how our framework can help at each step of the research process. Each of these sections of the book should be readable for anyone who has read part one. The entry on preanalysis plans can be assigned in an experiments course as guidance for students filing their first paps. The entry on research ethics could be shared amongst coauthors at the start of a project. The entry on writing a research paper could be assigned to college seniors trying hard to finish their essay on time. "],
["how-to-work-this-book.html", "1.2 How to work this book", " 1.2 How to work this book At many times throughout the book, we will describe research designs not just in words, but in computer code. You can read all of Part I without any coding, but some aspects of Part II and Part III are enhanced by engaging with the code. If you want to work though all of the code and exercises, fantastic. We’re here for you. This path requires investment in R, the tidyverse and the DeclareDesign set of software packages. We think it’s very rewarding but we understand that there is a learning curve. You could, of course, tackle the declaration, diagnosis, and redesign processes using bespoke simulations in any computer language you like, but it’s easier in DeclareDesign. If you want nothing to do with the code, you can skip all the code and exercises to just focus on the text. We’ve self-consciously written the book so that understanding of the code is not required in order to understand the research design concepts under discussions. If you are choosing this path, we promise our way of thinking about research design is useful even without any code. The free, online version of this book has many extra ways to engage with the material. You can download any section of code and you can play with interactive simulations. These bells and whistles are not necessary for understanding, but they can help make some of the finer points clearer. "],
["what-this-book-will-not-do.html", "1.3 What this book will not do", " 1.3 What this book will not do This is a research design textbook, not a statistics textbook. We will not derive estimators, we will provide no optimality guarantees, and we will present no proofs. By the same token – this is a research design textbook, not a handbook of best practices for all research designs. We can’t tell you the best thing to do in your particular research scenarios because we know far far less about your research than you do – you have to learn for yourself what the most important design considerations will be. What we do have is language to express research designs. We can help you to learn that language so you can describe your own design in it. When you can declare your design in this language, then you can diagnose it, then improve it through redesign. "],
["improving-research-designs.html", "Chapter 2 Improving research designs", " Chapter 2 Improving research designs As empirical social scientists, we routinely face two research design problems. First, we need to select high-quality designs, given financial and practical constraints. Second, we need to communicate those designs to readers and reviewers. To select strong designs, we often rely on rules of thumb, simple power calculators, or principles from the methodological literature that typically address one component of a design while assuming optimal conditions for others. These relatively informal practices can result in the selection of suboptimal designs, or worse, designs that are simply too weak to deliver useful answers. To convince others of the quality of our designs, we often defend them with references to previous studies that used similar approaches, with power analyses that may rely on assumptions unknown even to ourselves, or with ad hoc simulation code. In cases of dispute over the merits of different approaches, disagreements sometimes fall back on first principles or epistemological debates rather than on demonstrations of the conditions under which one approach does better than another. In this paper we describe an approach to address these problems. We introduce a framework — MIDA — that asks researchers to specify information about their background model (M), their inquiry (I), their data strategy (D), and their answer strategy (A). We then introduce the notion of “diagnosands,” or quantitative summaries of design properties. Familiar diagnosands include statistical power, the bias of an estimator with respect to an estimand, or the coverage probability of a procedure for generating confidence intervals. Many aspects of design quality can be assessed through design diagnosis, but many cannot. For instance the contribution to an academic literature, relevance to a policy decision, and impact on public debate are unlikely to be quantifiable ex ante. Using this framework, researchers can declare a research design as a computer code object and then diagnose its statistical properties on the basis of this declaration. A researcher may declare the features of designs in our framework for their own understanding and declaring designs may be useful before or after the research is implemented. Researchers can declare and diagnose their designs with the companion software for this paper, DeclareDesign, but the principles of design declaration and diagnosis do not depend on any particular software implementation. The formal characterization and diagnosis of designs before implementation can serve many purposes. First, researchers can learn about and improve their inferential strategies. Done at this stage, diagnosis of a design and alternatives can help a researcher select from a range of designs, a process we call “redesign.” Later, a researcher may include design declaration and diagnosis as part of a preanalysis plan or in a funding request. At this stage, the full specification of a design serves a communication function and enables third parties to understand a design and an author’s intentions. Even if declared ex-post, formal declaration still has benefits. The characterization can help readers understand the properties of a research project, facilitate transparent replication, and can help guide future (re-)analysis of the study data. "],
["design-declaration-model-inquiry-data-strategy-answer-strategy.html", "2.1 Design Declaration: Model-Inquiry-Data Strategy-Answer Strategy", " 2.1 Design Declaration: Model-Inquiry-Data Strategy-Answer Strategy A declaration of a research design comprises four components: a causal model of the world, which defines a set of units we want to learn about, a set of variables that represent characteristics of the units, and how those variables interact a research inquiry, which is a function of variables defined in the model a data strategy to intervene in the world to learn an answer to the inquiry, including interventions that are implemented but also measurement that is collected, and an answer strategy that defines how we construct an answer to the inquiry from the data that results from implementing our data strategy. The four together, which we refer to as MIDA, represent both your suppositions about how the world works and the choices you make as the researcher to intervene in and learn about the world. The model defines a set of units, people or neighborhoods or social groups, that we wish to study. Often, this set of units is a large population of units we cannot afford to take measurements of, but we can nevertheless define and make inferences about through sampling and studying a subset of its units. The model then includes a set of baseline characteristics that describe each unit and the probability distributions of each characteristic (i.e., are heights normally distributed, or is there skew that comes from stunting in infants). Finally, the model includes a set of endogenous outcome variables that may be functions of exogenous (pretreatment) characteristics and the effects of interventions. Each endogenous outcome variable has a function that defines the variables that affect what values it takes on. When an outcome depends on an intervention, it will be a potential outcome, where we can define what value the outcome would take on if a unit received the treatment and what outcome that unit would take on if it did not receive the treatment. Typically, endogenous outcome variables are random variables, either because it is a function of an exogenous baseline variable for which we defined a probability distributions or because whether a unit is assigned to treatment or control is randomly assigned as part of the data strategy. Defining the model can feel like an odd exercise. Since researchers presumably want to learn about the model, declaring it in advance may seem to beg the question. Yet declaring a model is often unavoidable when declaring reserach designs. In practice, doing so is already familiar to any researcher who has calculated the power of a design, which requires the specification of effect sizes. The seeming arbitrariness of the declared model can be mitigated by assessing the sensitivity of diagnosis to alternative models and strategies (see Section XX). Further, researchers can inform their substantive models with existing data, such as baseline surveys. Just as power calculators focus attention on minimum detectable effects, design declaration offers a tool to demonstrate design properties and how they change depending on researcher assumptions. The second component of a research design is the inquiry, often known as the estimand. This is a quantity that represents the true answer to the research question we are asking. Inquiries may be causal, as in the average treatment effect, or descriptive, as in the proportion of units who hold a certain characteristic. An inquiry is a function of the exogenous characteristics of units, of endogenous outcome variables, or both. It may be defined over all units in the population defined by the model, as in the average treatment effect for all units, or it may be defined over a subset of units, as in the conditional average treatment effect for women. Because we defined the distribution of the variables in the model, we can define the probability distribution of inquiries, which are a function of those variables. The data strategy defines how the researcher, along with research partners, intervenes in the world to generate an answer to the question posed by the inquiry. The researcher must select a sampling strategy for measurement, which could be to take measurements of all units or to first sample a subset of units. It includes the treatments and treatment assignment procedures. And it includes the measurement procedure itself, defining the set of survey questions or administrative data that will be collected from selected units. In short, the data strategy is everything the researcher does to obtain a set of data or observations used to answer the inquiry about the world. With the data that results from the data strategy, the answer strategy defines a set of procedures the researcher uses to translate the data into an answer to the inquiry. It is not simply the choice of an estimator, such as OLS or logit, but the full set of procedures from receiving the dataset to providing the answer in words, tables, and graphs. This includes data cleaning, data transformation, estimation, plotting, and interpretation. Not only the choice of OLS must be defined, but that we will focus attention on the coefficient estimate from the Z variable and assess uncertainty using a confidence interval and construct a coefficient plot in a certain way to visualize the inference. The answer strategy also includes all of the if-then procedures that researchers implicitly or explicitly take depending on initial results and features of the data. In a stepwise regression procedure, the answer strategy is not the final regression that results from iterative model selection, but that procedure itself – because the answer will depend on features of that change depending on sampling variability. Just like the values of the inquiry, the values of the estimates that result from the answer strategy have a probability distribution, because they are the result of the variables defined in the model (which have probability distributions) and the data strategy (sampling and treatment assignment are defined by probability distributions). Declaring a design entails separating out which parts of your idea belong in \\(M\\), \\(I\\), \\(D\\), and \\(A\\). The declaration process can be a challenge because mapping your ideas and excitement about your project into MIDA is not always straightforward. We promise it is a rewarding task. When you can express your research design in terms of these four components you are newly able to think about its properties. 2.1.1 Example: Gulzar and Khan (n.d.) In an experiment in two districts in Pakistan, Gulzar and Khan (n.d.) study how to motivate citizens to run for political office for the first time. Thus, their set of units is all citizens in Haripur and Abbottabad, about whom they consider baseline policy preferences, in order to characterize how different the policy preferences of citizens are from those eventually elected. Their endogenous outcomes of interest are whether the citizen filed papers to run for office; whether the citizen was elected; and the Euclidean distance of the citizen’s preferences from average citizen preferences. The outcomes are a function in their causal model of three treatments, which emphasize either the social or personal benefits to holding public office or do not encourage anyone to run for office at all. Their model would include an expected treatment effect magnitude for each treatment and their suppositions about how correlated outcomes are within villages that they study. gulzar_khan_design &lt;- declare_population( # study is conducted in two districts in Pakistan, with 311 and 359 villages in them districts = add_level(N = 2, name = c(&quot;Haripur&quot;, &quot;Abbottabad&quot;), N_villages = c(311, 359)), # villages nested within districts villages = add_level(N = N_villages), # avg. 6500 citizens per village citizens = add_level(N = 6500) ) + # main outcome is whether a citizen filed papers to run for office # we define potential outcomes in response to being assigned to a social, personal, or neutral appeal to run declare_potential_outcomes( filed_papers ~ rbinom(N, 1, prob = 0.05 + 0.05 * (Z_appeal == &quot;social&quot;) + 0.01 * (Z_appeal == &quot;personal&quot;)), assignment_variable = Z_appeal, conditions = c(&quot;neutral&quot;, &quot;social&quot;, &quot;personal&quot;) ) + # inquiry is the difference in rates of filing papers between the social and personal appeal conditions declare_estimand(ATE = mean(filed_papers_Z_appeal_social - filed_papers_Z_appeal_personal)) + # sample 192 villages declare_sampling(clusters = villages, n = 192, sampling_variable = &quot;S_villages&quot;) + # sample 48 citizens in each village via random walk declare_sampling(strata = villages, n = 48, sampling_variable = &quot;S_citizens&quot;) + # assign villages to three arms with equal probabilities for three types of appeals to run for office declare_assignment( m_each = c(48, 72, 72), clusters = villages, conditions = c(&quot;neutral&quot;, &quot;social&quot;, &quot;personal&quot;), assignment_variable = Z_appeal ) + # recode treatment assignment for analysis into indicators for the two conditions of interest declare_step( Z_social_village = if_else(Z_appeal == &quot;social&quot;, 1, 0), Z_personal_village = if_else(Z_appeal == &quot;personal&quot;, 1, 0), handler = mutate ) + # 1. run a linear regression with condition indicators # 2. calculate the difference in effects between people in villages assigned to social appeals compared # to those assigned to personal appeals # 3. calculate robust standard errors clustered on village declare_estimator( filed_papers ~ Z_social_village + Z_personal_village, linear_hypothesis = &quot;Z_social_village - Z_personal_village = 0&quot;, term = &quot;Z_social_village - Z_personal_village = 0&quot;, clusters = villages, model = lh_robust ) The inquiry is the effect of an encouragement to vote focused on prosocial motivations for officeholding (rather than encouragements that emphasized personal benefits) on the rate of filing papers to run for office between people living in villages randomly assigned to receive. The data strategy in Gulzar and Khan (n.d.) entailed three steps: (1) randomly sampling 192 villages from among all villages in Haripur and Abbottabad districts, and using a random walk procedure to select 48 citizens in each village to participate in the experiment; (2) randomly-assigning each village with equal probability to one of three conditions (neutral, social benefits, or personal benefits); and (3) collecting administrative data on who filed papers to run and matching that back to pretreatment survey data on the 9,216 citizens. Sampling, treatment assignment, and measurement are the three common data strategy steps in an experiment; some experiments, instead, do not include a sampling step and instead assign treatments within a convenience sample. Gulzar and Khan (n.d.) have a two-step answer strategy, fitting a linear model predicting whether a citizen ran for office (the outcome) with indicators for the social benefits and the personal benefits treatments, and then calculating the difference between the two coefficients as an estimate of whether social benefits are more or less effective than the personal benefits. Their answer strategy includes presenting a table with estimated difference, a standard error clustered on village to account for village-level random assignment, and a p-value calculated using permutation inference.

["assessing-research-design-quality-design-diagnosis.html", "2.2 Assessing research design quality: design diagnosis", " 2.2 Assessing research design quality: design diagnosis Once you’ve declared your design, you can diagnose it. Design diagnosis is the process of simulating your research design in order to understand the range of possible ways the study could turn out. It is in the diagnosis stage that we define the design properties that are most desirable in our research setting. We let computers do the simulations for us because imagining how design choices influence sampling distributions is — to put it lightly — cognitively demanding. Diagnosis is an opportunity to write down what would make the study a success. For a long time, researchers have classified studies as successful or not based on statistical significance. Accordingly, statistical power (the probability of a statistically significant result) has been the most front-of-mind diagnosand when researchers have set to designing studies. As we learn more about the pathologies of relying on the statistical significance, we learn that diagnosands beyond power are just as, if not more important. For example, the “credibility revolution” throughout social science has trained a laser-like focus on the bias diagnosand. Studies are coming under new criticism for lacking “strong identification,” which usually implies that the data and answer strategies could lead to biased answers depending on how incorrect the model is. Randomized experimentation promises unbiased answers, at least when the data and answer strategies are implemented well. Design diagnosis relies on two further concepts, both functions of research designs. These are quantities that a researcher or a third party could calculate with respect to a design. The first is a diagnostic statistic, which is a summary statistic generated from a “run” of a design—that is, the results given a possible realization of variables, given the model and data strategy. For example the statistic: \\(e=\\) “difference between the estimated and the actual average treatment effect” depends on the model (since the ATE depends on the model’s assumptions about potential outcomes). The statistic \\(s = \\mathbb{1}(p \\leq 0.05)\\), interpreted as “the result is considered statistically significant at the 5% level,” does not depend on the model but it does presuppose an answer strategy that reports a \\(p\\)-value. Diagnostic statistics are governed by probability distributions that arise because both the model and the data generation, given the model, may be stochastic. Second, a diagnosand is a summary of the distribution of a diagnostic statistic. For example, is average value of the \\(e\\) statistic and is is the average value of the \\(s\\) statistic. Other diagnosands include things like root-mean-squared-error (RMSE), Type I, Type II, Type M, and Type S error rates. One especially important diagnosand is the “success rate,” which is the average value of the “success” diagnostic statistic. As a researcher, you get to decide what would make your study a success. What matters most in your research scenario? Is it statistical significance? If so, optimize your design with respect to power. Is what matters most in your research setting with the answer has the correct sign or not? Then diagnose how frequently your answer strategy yields an answer with the same sign as your inquiry. Diagnosis is an opportunity for you to articulate what would make your study a success and then to simulate how often you obtain that success. "],
["redesign.html", "2.3 Redesign", " 2.3 Redesign The subtitle of this book is “Declaration, Diagnosis, Redesign” to emphasize three important steps in the conceptualization of a research design. So far, we’ve outlined the first two points: declaration and diagnosis. Once your design has been declared, and you have learned to diagnose it with respect to the most important diagnosands, the last step is redesign. Redesign entails playing with each of the design parameters to understand the implications of each for your most important diagnosands. This can mean a variety of things. Many diagnosands (power, RMSE) depend on the size of the study. We can redesign the study, varying the “sample size” feature of the data strategy to determine how big it needs to be to achieve a target diagnosand: 90% power, say, or an RMSE of 0.02. We could also vary an aspect of the answer strategy, say, the covariates used to adjust a regression model. Sometimes the changes to the data and answer strategies interact: if we use better covariates to increase the precision of the estimates in the answer strategy, we have to collect that information as a part of the data strategy. The redesign question now becomes, is it better to collect pre-treatment information from all subjects or is the money better spent on increasing the total number of subjects? Finally, redesign sometimes means changing the model. That is, sometimes we want to understand whether our design yields the right inferences even when the underlying data generating processes shift beneath our feet. In summary, redesign entails enumerating a set of possible designs given resource and theoretical constraints then picking the best one. "],

In both cases, the set of components are closely aligned to those in the framework we propose. References "],
["putting-designs-to-use.html", "2.5 Putting designs to use", " 2.5 Putting designs to use In this book, we are asking that scholars add a new step to their workflow. We want scholars to formally declare and diagnose their research designs both in order to learn about them and to improve them. Much of the work of declaring and diagnosing designs is already part of how social scientists conduct research: grant proposals, IRB protocols, preanalysis plans, and dissertation prospectuses contain design information and justifications for why the design is appropriate for the question. The lack of a common language to describe designs and their properties, however, seriously hampers the utility of these practices for assessing and improving design quality. We hope that the inclusion of a declaration-diagnosis-redesign step to the research process can help address this basic difficulty. We outline three phases of the scientific process during which the MIDA and declaration-diagnosis-redesign framework can assist study authors, readers, and research funders. Making design choices. The move towards increasing credibility of research in the social sciences places a premium on considering alternative data strategies and analysis strategies at early stages of research projects, not only because it reduces researcher discretion, but more importantly because it can improve the quality of the final research design. While there is nothing new about the idea of determining features such as sampling and estimation strategies ex ante, in practice many designs are finalized late in the research process, after data are collected. Frontloading design decisions is difficult not only because existing tools are rudimentary and often misleading, but because it is not clear in current practice what features of a design must be considered ex ante. We provide a framework for identifying which features affect the assessment of a design’s properties, declaring designs and diagnosing their inferential quality, and frontloading design decisions. Declaring the design’s features in code enables direct exploration of alternative data and analysis strategies using simulated data; evaluating alternative strategies through diagnosis; and exploring the robustness of a chosen strategy to alternative models. Researchers can undertake each step before study implementation or data collection. Communicating design choices. Bias in published results can arise for many reasons. For example, researchers may deliberately or inadvertently select analysis strategies because they produce statistically significant results. Proposed solutions to reduce this kind of bias focus on various types of preregistration of analysis strategies by researchers (Rennie 2004; Zarin and Tse 2008; Casey, Glennerster, and Miguel 2012; Nosek et al. 2015; Green and Lin 2016). Study registries are now operating in numerous areas of social science, including those hosted by the American Economic Association, Evidence in Governance and Politics, and the Center for Open Science. Bias may also arise from reviewers basing publication recommendations on statistical significance. Results-blind review processes are being introduced in some journals to address this form of bias (e.g. Findley et al. 2016). However, the effectiveness of design registries and results-blind review in reducing the scope for either form of publication bias depends on clarity over which elements must be included to describe the design. In practice, some registries rely on checklists and preanalysis plans exhibit great variation, ranging from lists of written hypotheses to all-but-results journal articles. In our view, the solution to this problem does not lie in ever-more-specific questionnaires, but rather in a new way of characterizing designs whose analytic features can be diagnosed through simulation. The actions to be taken by researchers are described by the data strategy and the answer strategy; these two features of a design are clearly relevant elements of a preregistration document. In order to know which design choices were made ex ante and which were arrived at ex post, researchers need to communicate their data and answer strategies unambiguously. However, assessing whether the data and answer strategies are any good usually requires specifying a model and an inquiry. Design declaration can clarify for researchers and third parties what aspects of a study need to be specified in order to meet standards for effective preregistration. Declaration of a design in code also enables a final and infrequently practiced step of the registration process, in which the researcher ``reports and reconciles’’ the final with the planned analysis. Identifying how and whether the features of a design diverge between ex ante and ex post declarations highlights deviations from the preanalysis plan. The magnitude of such deviations determines whether results should be considered exploratory or confirmatory. At present, this exercise requires a review of dozens of pages of text, such that differences (or similarities) are not immediately clear even to close readers. Reconciliation of designs declared in code can be conducted automatically, by comparing changes to the code itself (e.g., a move from the use of a stratified sampling function to simple random sampling) and by comparing key variables in the design such as sample sizes. Challenging Design Choices. The independent replication of the results of studies after their publication is an essential component of the shift toward more credible science. Replication — whether verification, reanalysis of the original data, or reproduction using fresh studies — provides incentives for researchers to be clear and transparent in their analysis strategies, and can build confidence in findings.1 In addition to rendering the design more transparent, design declaration can allow for a different approach to the re-analysis and critique of published research. A standard practice for replicators engaging in reanalysis is to propose a range of alternative strategies and assess the robustness of the data-dependent estimates to different analyses. The problem with this approach is that, when divergent results are found, third parties do not have clear grounds to decide which results to believe. This issue is compounded by the fact that, in changing the analysis strategy, replicators risk departing from the estimand of the original study, possibly providing different answers to different questions. In the worst case scenario, it can be difficult to determine what is learned both from the original study and from the replication. A more coherent strategy facilitated by design simulations would be to use a design declaration to conduct “design replication.” In a design replication, a scholar restates the essential design characteristics to learn about what the study could have revealed, not just what the original author reports was revealed. This helps to answer the question: under what conditions are the results of a study to be believed? By emphasizing abstract properties of the design, design replication provides grounds to support alternative analyses on the basis of the original authors’ intentions and not on the basis of the degree of divergence of results. Conversely, it provides authors with grounds to question claims made by their critics. References "],
["avoiding-declaration-and-diagnosis-pitfalls.html", "2.6 Avoiding declaration and diagnosis pitfalls", " 2.6 Avoiding declaration and diagnosis pitfalls Declaring a design is just like writing out a recipe. You can cook without writing out a recipe, but when you do, you can think through the whole process start to finish, you can critique the process, and you can modify it. That said, designing high quality research is difficult and comes with many pitfalls, only a subset of which are ameliorated by the MIDA framework. Others we fail to address entirely and in some cases, we may even exacerbate them. We outline four concerns. The first is the worry that evaluative weight could get placed on essentially meaningless diagnoses. Given that design declaration includes declarations of conjectures about the world it is possible to choose inputs so that a design passes any diagnostic test set for it. For instance, a simulation-based claim to unbiasedness that incorporates all features of a design is still only good with respect to the precise conditions of the simulation (in contrast, analytic results, when available, may extend over general classes of designs). Still worse, simulation parameters might be selected because of their properties. A power analysis, for instance, may be useless if implausible parameters are chosen to raise power artificially. While MIDA may encourage more honest declarations, there is nothing in the framework that enforces them. As ever, garbage-in, garbage-out. Second, we see a risk that research may get evaluated on the basis of a narrow, but perhaps inappropriate set of diagnosands. Statistical power is often invoked as a key design feature – but even well-powered studies that are biased away from their targets of interest are of little theoretical use. The appropriateness of the diagnosand depends on the purposes of the study. As MIDA is silent on the question of a study’s purpose, it cannot guide researchers or critics to the appropriate set of diagnosands by which to evaluate a design. An advantage of the approach however is that the choice of diagnosands gets highlighted and new diagnosands can be generated in response to substantive concerns. Third, emphasis on the statistical properties of a design can obscure the substantive importance of a question being answered or other qualitative features of a design. A similar concern has been raised regarding the ``identification revolution’’ where a focus on identification risks crowding out attention to the importance of questions being addressed . Our framework can help researchers determine whether a particular design answers a question well (or at all), and it also nudges them to make sure that their questions are defined clearly and . It cannot, however, help researchers choose good questions. Finally, we see a risk that the variation in the suitability of design declaration to different research strategies may be taken as evidence of the relative superiority of different types of research strategies. While we believe that the range of strategies that can be declared and diagnosed is wider than what one might at first think possible, there is no reason to believe that all strong designs can be declared either ex ante or ex post. An advantage of our framework, we hope, is that it can help clarify when a strategy can or cannot be completely declared. When a design cannot be declared, nondeclarability is all the framework provides, and in such cases we urge caution in drawing conclusions about design quality. MIDA captures the analysis-relevant features of a design, but it does not describe substantive elements, such as how theories are derived or interventions are implemented. Yet many other aspects of a design that are not explicitly labeled in these features enter into this framework if they are analytically relevant. For example, logistical details of data collection such as the duration of time between a treatment being administered and endline data collection enter into the model if the longer time until data collection affects subject recall of the treatment. However, information in MIDA is typically insufficient to assess those substantive elements, an important and separate part of assessing the quality of a research study. "],
["software-primer.html", "Chapter 3 Software primer", " Chapter 3 Software primer You can implement the MIDA framework in any software package. Indeed, a design could be declared in writing or mathematical notation and then diagnosed using analytical formula.2 Social scientists use a number of tools for conducting statistical analysis: Stata, R, Python, Julia, SPSS, SAS, Mathematica, and more. Stata and R are most commonly used. We wrote DeclareDesign in the R statistical environment because of the availability of other tools for implementing research designs and because it is free-to-use. We have designed the rest of the book so that it can be read even if you do not use R, but you will have to translate the code into your own language of choice. On our Web site, we have a translation of parts of the declaration and diagnosis process into Stata, Python, and Excel. In addition we link to a “Design wizard” that lets you declare and diagnose variations of standard designs via a web interface. In this section, we introduce you to DeclareDesign for R and how each step of the design-diagnose-redesign process can be implemented in it. However, we suggested in Section XX why analytical diagnoses may not be ideal for typical designs in the social sciences: they do not account for the specific features of research designs such as varying numbers of units per cluster and the interaction of choices about a data strategy and an answer strategy.↩ "],

In this case, we select the bias (difference between the estimate and the estimand, which is the PATE); the root mean-squared error; and the statistical power of the design. # Select diagnosands simple_design_diagnosands &lt;- declare_diagnosands(select = c(bias, rmse, power)) We then diagnose the design, which involves simulating the design and again and again, and then calculate the diagnosands based on the simulations data. # Diagnose the design simple_design_diagnosis &lt;- diagnose_design(simple_design, diagnosands = simple_design_diagnosands, sims = 500) estimand_label estimator_label bias rmse power PATE estimator -0.0020108 0.2912167 0.146 3.2.3 Redesign We see that the power of the design is small, so we increase the number of sampled units from 50 to 100. replace_step creates a new design, swapping out the fourth step (sampling) for a modified sampling step. redesigned_simple_design &lt;- replace_step(simple_design, step = 4, new_step = declare_sampling(n = 100)) With the big picture of the declaration, diagnosis, and redesign of a simple design in mind, we now turn to building up from a single step to a full declared design.

["building-a-step-of-a-research-design.html", "3.3 Building a step of a research design", " 3.3 Building a step of a research design We begin learning about how to build a research design in DeclareDesign by declaring a single step: random assignment. We take as a starting point a fixed set of data, describing a set of voters in Los Angeles. The research project we are planning involves randomly assigning voters to receive a knock on their door from a canvasser (or not to receive a door knock). Our data look like this: ID age sex party precinct 001 62 F DEM 7356 002 69 M REP 8304 003 46 M GRN 6938 004 57 M GRN 2962 005 26 M GRN 2786 006 58 F DEM 7684 There are 100 voters in the dataset. DeclareDesign makes writing each design step just a bit easier. Instead of writing a function each time, it writes a function for us. The core of DeclareDesign is a set of declare_* functions, including declare_assignment. Each one is a function factory, meaning it takes a set of parameters about your research design like the number of units and the random assignment probability as inputs, and returns a function as an output. Instead of writing the function simple_random_assignment_function as we did above, in DeclareDesign we declare it: simple_random_assignment_step &lt;- declare_assignment(prob = 0.5) simple_random_assignment_step is a tidy function. You can run the function on data: simple_random_assignment_step(voter_file) ID age sex party precinct Z Z_cond_prob 001 62 F DEM 7356 0 0.5 002 69 M REP 8304 0 0.5 003 46 M GRN 6938 1 0.5 004 57 M GRN 2962 0 0.5 005 26 M GRN 2786 0 0.5 006 58 F DEM 7684 0 0.5 A few parts of the declaration may seem a little bit odd. First, we did not tell R anything about the number of units in our dataset. Second, we didn’t give it the data! This is because a step declaration creates a function that will work on any size dataset. We told declare_assignment that we want to assign treatment with probability 0.5 (and implicitly control with probability 1-0.5 = 0.5), regardless of how large the dataset is. We did not send the declaration the data, because declare_assignment automatically creates a tidy function for us, one that takes data and returns data with an assignment step. We will see in a moment how DeclareDesign uses these functions to simulate data from a research design. But you can always use the function yourself with your own data. When you implement your research design after you have conducted it, you can use the exact same functions you diagnosed the design with. This is one of the reasons we declare the assignment step — because we’ll learn about the properties of your design with the same code you can actually use to randomly assign treatment. Every step of a research design in MIDA can be written using one of the declare_* functions. In the next section, we walk through each step and how to declare it using DeclareDesign. "],
["research-design-steps.html", "3.4 Research design steps", " 3.4 Research design steps In this section, we walk through how to declare each step of a research design using DeclareDesign. In the next section, we build those steps into a research design, and then describe how to interrogate the design. 3.4.1 Model The model defines the structure of the world, both its size and background characteristics as well as how interventions in the world determine outcomes. In DeclareDesign, we split the model into two main design steps: the population and potential outcomes. There is always one population in a design, but there can be multiple sets of potential outcomes. 3.4.1.1 Population The population defines the number of units in the population, any multilevel structure to the data, and its background characteristics. We can define the population in several ways. In some cases, you may start a design with data on the population. When that happens, we do not to simulate it. We can simply declare the data as our population: declare_population(data = voter_file) ID age sex party precinct 001 62 F DEM 7356 002 69 M REP 8304 003 46 M GRN 6938 004 57 M GRN 2962 005 26 M GRN 2786 006 58 F DEM 7684 When we do not have complete data on the population, we simulate it. Relying on the data simulation functions from our fabricatr package, declare_population asks about the size and variables of the population: declare_population(N = 100, u = rnorm(N)) When we run the declared population function, we will get a different 100-unit dataset each time: ID u 001 0.4598741 002 0.3721679 003 -0.3667387 004 1.1287322 005 -0.5284456 006 -0.0035591 ID u 001 -0.5967198 002 1.5838514 003 1.1512866 004 1.7516006 005 0.2776550 006 -0.2113345 ID u 001 -0.7636993 002 -0.2693892 003 -0.1142551 004 -0.8041561 005 0.4863978 006 -3.3507406 The fabricatr package can simulate data for social science research including multilevel data structures like students in classrooms in schools. You can read the fabricatr Web site to get started simulating your data structure (link). A simple two-level data structure of individuals within households could be declared as: declare_population( households = add_level(N = 100, individuals_per_hh = sample(1:10, N, replace = TRUE)), individuals = add_level(N = individuals_per_hh, age = sample(1:100, N, replace = TRUE)) ) In every step of the research design process, you can short-circuit our default way of doing things and bring in your own code. This is useful when you have a complex design, or when you’ve already written code for your design and you want to use it directly. It works by setting the handler: complex_population_function &lt;- function(data, N_units) { data.frame(u = rnorm(N_units)) } declare_population(handler = complex_population_function, N_units = 100) 3.4.1.2 Potential outcomes Defining potential outcomes is as easy as a single expression per potential outcome. These may be a function of background characteristics, other potential outcomes, or other R functions.4 declare_potential_outcomes( Y_Z_0 = u, Y_Z_1 = Y_Z_0 + 0.25) des &lt;- declare_population(N = 100, u = rnorm(N)) + declare_potential_outcomes(Y_Z_0 = u, Y_Z_1 = Y_Z_0 + 0.25) draw_data(des) ID u Y_Z_0 Y_Z_1 001 0.6804485 0.6804485 0.9304485 002 -1.4162075 -1.4162075 -1.1662075 003 -0.8438335 -0.8438335 -0.5938335 004 0.1200255 0.1200255 0.3700255 005 -0.5655772 -0.5655772 -0.3155772 006 1.8667367 1.8667367 2.1167367 We also have a simpler interface to define all the potential outcomes at once as a function of a treatment assignment variable. The names of the potential outcomes are constructed from the outcome name (here Y on the lefthand side of the formula) and from the assignment_variables argument (here Z). declare_potential_outcomes(Y ~ u + 0.25 * Z, assignment_variables = Z) Either way of creating potential outcomes works; one may be easier or harder to code up in a given research design setting. 3.4.2 Inquiry To define your inquiry, declare your estimand, which is a function of background characteristics from your population, potential outcomes, or both. We define the average treatment effect for the experiment in our simple design as follows: declare_estimand(PATE = mean(Y_Z_1 - Y_Z_0)) Notice that we defined the PATE (the population average treatment effect), but said nothing special related to the population. In fact, it looks like we just defined the average treatment effect. This is because where you define the estimand in your design is going to determine whether it refers to the population, sample, or other form of estimand. We will see how to do this in a moment. 3.4.3 Data strategy The data strategy constitutes one or more steps representing interventions the researcher makes in the world from sampling to assignment to measurement. Typically, this may include sampling and assignment. 3.4.3.1 Sampling The sampling step relies on the randomizr package to conduct random sampling. See Section XX for an overview of the many kinds of sampling that are possible. We define a simple 50-unit sample from the population as follows: declare_sampling(n = 50) When we draw data from our simple design at this point, it will be smaller: from 100 units in the population to a data frame of 50 units representing the sample. In the data frame, we have an inclusion probability, the probability of being included in the sample. randomizr includes this by default. In this case, every unit in the population had an equal 0.5 probability of inclusion. ID u Y_Z_0 Y_Z_1 S_inclusion_prob 1 001 0.1335497 0.1335497 0.3835497 0.5 4 004 2.1308908 2.1308908 2.3808908 0.5 6 006 -0.3987574 -0.3987574 -0.1487574 0.5 9 009 0.9731611 0.9731611 1.2231611 0.5 11 011 1.5829870 1.5829870 1.8329870 0.5 12 012 -0.1009000 -0.1009000 0.1491000 0.5 Sampling could also be non-random, which could be accomplished by using a handler. 3.4.3.2 Assignment Assignment also relies, by default, on the randomizr package for random assignment. Here, we define assignment as a 50% probability of assignment to treatment and 50% to control. declare_assignment(prob = 0.5) Assignment results in a data frame with an additional indicator Z of the assignment as well as the probability of assignment. Again, here the assignment probabilities are constant, but in other designs described in Section XX they are not and this is crucial information for the analysis stage.

Others may include merging in fixed administrative data from other sources, collapsing data across months or days, and other operations. You can include these as steps in your design too, using declare_step. Here, you must define a handler, as we did for using a custom function in declare_population. Some handlers that may prove useful are the dplyr verbs such as mutate and summarize, and the fabricate function from our fabricatr package. To add a variable using fabricate: declare_step(handler = fabricate, add_variable = rnorm(N)) If you have district-month data you may want to analyze at the district level, collapsing across months:5 collapse_data &lt;- function(data, collapse_by) { data %&gt;% group_by({{ collapse_by }}) %&gt;% summarize_all(mean, na.rm = TRUE) } declare_step(handler = collapse_data, collapse_by = district) 3.4.4 Answer strategy Through our model and data strategy steps, we have simulated a dataset with two key inputs to the answer strategy: an assignment variable and an outcome. In other answer strategies, pretreatment characteristics from the model might also be relevant. The data look like this: ID u Y_Z_0 Y_Z_1 S_inclusion_prob Z Z_cond_prob Y 001 0.0998142 0.0998142 0.3498142 0.5 1 0.5 0.3498142 003 0.5348448 0.5348448 0.7848448 0.5 1 0.5 0.7848448 004 0.6591223 0.6591223 0.9091223 0.5 0 0.5 0.6591223 005 -0.0673876 -0.0673876 0.1826124 0.5 0 0.5 -0.0673876 006 1.0202084 1.0202084 1.2702084 0.5 1 0.5 1.2702084 014 0.2472831 0.2472831 0.4972831 0.5 0 0.5 0.2472831 Our estimator is the difference-in-means estimator, which compares outcomes between the group that was assigned to treatment and that assigned to control. We can calculate the difference-in-means estimate with a call to summarize from dplyr: simple_design_data %&gt;% summarize(DiM = mean(Y[Z == 1]) - mean(Y[Z == 0])) DiM -0.2340095 The estimatr package makes this easy and calculates the design-based standard error and a p-value and confidence interval for you: difference_in_means(Y ~ Z, data = simple_design_data) term estimate std.error statistic p.value conf.low conf.high df outcome Z -0.2340095 0.3020151 -0.7748269 0.4425371 -0.8424771 0.3744582 44.52826 Y Now, in order to declare our estimator, we can send the name of a model to declare_estimator. R has many models that work with declare_estimator, including lm, glm, the ictreg package from the list package, etc. The design-based estimators from estimatr can all be used. declare_estimator(Y ~ Z, model = difference_in_means, estimand = &quot;PATE&quot;) In this declaration, we also define the estimand we are targeting with the difference-in-means estimator.6 Typically, you will have an estimand that you are targeting, and sometimes you may consider targeting more than one and assessing how good your estimator estimates them. For example, you may want to know how good a job your instrumental variables job is at targeting the complier average causal effect, but also how close it gets on average to the average treatment effect. Typically, we think of potential outcomes as fixed and not random, and move random variables to the population.↩ The {{ }} syntax is handy for writing functions in dplyr where you want to be able reuse the function with different variable names. Here, the collapse_data function will group_by the variable you send to the argument collapse_by, which in our declaration we set to district. The pipeline within the function then calculates the mean in each district.↩ Sometimes, you may be interested just in the properties of an estimator, such as calculating its power. In this case, you need not define an estimand.↩ "],
["building-a-design-from-design-steps.html", "3.5 Building a design from design steps", " 3.5 Building a design from design steps In the last section, we defined a set of individual research steps. We draw one version of them together here: population &lt;- declare_population(N = 100, u = rnorm(N)) potential_outcomes &lt;- declare_potential_outcomes(Y_Z_0 = u, Y_Z_1 = Y_Z_0 + 0.25) estimand &lt;- declare_estimand(PATE = mean(Y_Z_1 - Y_Z_0)) sampling &lt;- declare_sampling(n = 50) assignment &lt;- declare_assignment(prob = 0.5) reveal &lt;- declare_reveal(outcome_variables = Y, assignment_variables = Z) estimator &lt;- declare_estimator(Y ~ Z, model = difference_in_means, estimand = &quot;PATE&quot;) To construct a research design object that we can operate on — diagnose it, redesign it, draw data from it, etc. — we add them together with the + operator. The + creates a design object. simple_design &lt;- population + potential_outcomes + estimand + sampling + assignment + reveal + estimator In the book, we’ll use a more compact way of writing a design, where we define it all at once with the +: simple_design &lt;- declare_population(N = 100, u = rnorm(N)) + declare_potential_outcomes(Y_Z_0 = u, Y_Z_1 = Y_Z_0 + 0.25) + declare_estimand(PATE = mean(Y_Z_1 - Y_Z_0)) + declare_sampling(n = 50) + declare_assignment(prob = 0.5) + declare_reveal(outcome_variables = Y, assignment_variables = Z) + declare_estimator(Y ~ Z, model = difference_in_means, estimand = &quot;PATE&quot;) 3.5.1 Order matters When defining a design, the order steps are included in the design via the + operator matters. Think of the order of your design as the causal order in which steps take place. population + potential_outcomes + estimand + sampling + assignment + reveal + estimator The order encodes several important aspects of the design: - First, the fact that the estimand follows the potential outcomes and comes before sampling and assignment means it is a population estimand, the population average treatment effect. This is because it is calculated on the data created so far. - The estimator comes after the assignment and reveal outcomes steps. If it didn’t, our difference-in-means would not work, because it wouldn’t have access to the treatment variable and the realized outcomes. "],
["simulating-a-research-design.html", "3.6 Simulating a research design", " 3.6 Simulating a research design Diagnosing a research design — learning about its properties — requires first simulating running the design over and over.

They chain together functions in a similar way to a dplyr or ggplot pipeline.

For example, in our design the estimand comes just after the potential outcomes. In this design, draw_estimands will run the first two steps and then calculate the estimands from the estimand function we declared: draw_estimands(simple_design) estimand_label estimand PATE 0.25 Similarly, we can simulate the estimates from a single run with draw_estimates which draws data and at the appropriate moment calculates estimates. draw_estimates(simple_design) estimator_label term estimate std.error statistic p.value conf.low conf.high df outcome estimand_label estimator Z 0.4968018 0.2906494 1.709282 0.0938973 -0.0876813 1.081285 47.70528 Y PATE To diagnose a design, we want a data frame that includes the estimates and estimands from many runs of a design.

We have two ways to compare. First, we can compare the designs themselves — what kinds of estimates and estimands do they produce, what steps are in the design. And we can compare the diagnoses. We can do this using redesign: redesign(simple_design, N = c(100, 200, 300, 400, 500)) An alternative way to do this is to write a function that makes designs based on a set of these design inputs. This offers the researcher more flexibility in setting up the design variants. We call these functions designers. Here’s a simple designer based on our running example: simple_designer &lt;- function(sample_size, effect_size) { declare_population(N = sample_size, u = rnorm(N)) + declare_potential_outcomes(Y_Z_0 = u, Y_Z_1 = Y_Z_0 + effect_size) + declare_estimand(PATE = mean(Y_Z_1 - Y_Z_0)) + declare_sampling(n = 50) + declare_assignment(prob = 0.5) + declare_reveal(outcome_variables = Y, assignment_variables = Z) + declare_estimator(Y ~ Z, model = difference_in_means, estimand = &quot;PATE&quot;) } To create a single design, based on our original parameters of a 100-unit sample size and a treatment effect of 0.25, we can run: simple_design &lt;- simple_designer(sample_size = 100, effect_size = 0.25) Now to simulate multiple designs, we can use the DeclareDesign function expand_design. Here we examine our simple design under several possible sample sizes, which we might want to do to conduct a minimum power analysis. We hold the effect size constant. simple_designs &lt;- expand_design(simple_designer, sample_size = c(100, 500, 1000), effect_size = 0.25) Our simulation and diagnosis tools can take a set of expanded designs (an R list) and will simulate all of them at once, creating a column called design_label to keep them apart. For example: diagnose_design(simple_designs) 3.8.2 Library of designs In our DesignLibrary package, we have created a set of common designs as designers, so you can get started quickly and also easily set up a range of design variants for comparison. library(DesignLibrary) b_c_design &lt;- block_cluster_two_arm_designer(N = 1000, N_blocks = 10) diagnose_design(b_c_design) "],

["formalizing-mida.html", "Chapter 5 Formalizing MIDA", " Chapter 5 Formalizing MIDA In this section, we set the our approach on firmer mathematical grounds. In doing so, we employ elements from Pearl’s (2009) approach to causal modeling (directed acycling graphs, or DAGs for short), which provides a syntax for mapping design inputs to design outputs. We also use the potential outcomes framework as presented, for example, in Imbens and Rubin (2015), which many social scientists use to clarify their inferential targets. We’ll dive much more deeply into both DAGs and potential outcomes in Part II. A research design \\(\\Delta\\) includes four elements \\(&lt;M,I,D,A&gt;\\): A model, \\(M\\), of how the world works. In general following Pearl’s definition of a probabilistic causal model we will assume that a model contains three core elements. First, a specification of the variables \\(X\\) about which research is being conducted. This includes endogenous and exogenous variables (\\(V\\) and \\(U\\) respectively) and the ranges of these variables. In the formal literature this is sometimes called the signature of a model (Halpern 2000). Second, a specification of how each endogenous variable depends on other variables (the “functional relations” or, as in Imbens and Rubin (2015), “potential outcomes”), \\(F\\). Third, a probability distribution over exogenous variables, \\(P(U)\\). We write a draw from this distribution as \\(M() = m\\). An inquiry, \\(I\\), about the distribution of variables, \\(X\\), perhaps given interventions on some variables. Using Pearl’s notation we can distinguish between questions that ask about the conditional values of variables, such as \\(\\Pr(X_1 | X_2 =1)\\) and questions that ask about values that would arise under interventions: \\(\\Pr(X_1 | do(X_2 = 1))\\). The distinction lies in whether the conditional probability is recorded through passive observation or active intervention to manipulate the probabilities of the conditioning distribution. For example, \\(\\Pr(X_1 | X_2 =1)\\) might indicate the conditional probability that it is raining, given that Jack has his umbrella, whereas \\(\\Pr(X_1 | do(X_2 =1))\\) would indicate the probability with which it would rain, given that Jack is made to carry an umbrella. We let \\(a^M\\) denote the answer to \\(I\\) . Conditional on the model, \\(a^M\\) is the value of the estimand, the quantity that the researcher wants to learn about. The connection of \\(a^M\\) to the model can be seen in the following equality: \\(I(m) = a^M\\). A data strategy, \\(D\\), generates data \\(d\\) on \\(X\\). Data \\(d\\) arises, under model \\(M\\) with probability \\(P_M(d|D)\\). The data strategy includes sampling strategies and assignment strategies, which we denote with \\(P_S\\) and \\(P_Z\\) respectively. Measurement techniques are also a part of data strategies and can be thought of as a selection of observable variables that carry information about unobservable variables. The data strategy operates on a draw from the model to produce the observed data: \\(D(m) = d\\). An answer strategy, \\(A\\), that generates answer \\(a^D\\) using data \\(d\\). We encode this relationship as \\(A(d) = a^D\\). The full set of causal relationships between \\(M\\), \\(I\\), \\(D\\), and \\(A\\) with respect to \\(m\\), \\(a^M\\), \\(d\\) and \\(a^D\\) can be seen in the DAG schematic representation of a research design. Figure 5.1: MIDA as a DAG The tight correspondence between \\(I(m) = a^M\\) and \\(A(d) = a^D\\) points out how a research design is a correspondence between two joint distributions and their summaries. The joint distributions described by \\(M\\) and \\(D\\) are causally related, but they are distinct. \\(M\\) reflects our beliefs about true underlying causal processes at work where \\(D\\) is the procedure that results in the collection or creation of data. (The phrase “data generating process” can be a little confusing – usually people use “true DGP” to refer to \\(M\\), even though \\(M\\) doesn’t create data, \\(D\\) does). \\(I\\) is a summary of a draw from \\(M\\) (\\(m\\)); \\(A\\) is a summary of a draw from \\(D\\) (\\(d\\)). Terminology note. \\(I\\) is the inquiry. \\(I(M) =a^M\\) is the estimand. \\(A\\) is the estimator, inclusive of all the data munging steps. \\(a^D\\) is the estimate. 5.0.1 Formalizing Diagnosis Research designs are stronger when the distributions of \\(a^M\\) and \\(a^D\\) are more similar. To characterize how close the two distributions are, we turn to research design diagnosis. Design diagnosis is the process of simulating both \\(I(m) = a^M\\) and \\(A(d) = a^M\\) over many draws from \\(M()\\) and \\(D(m)\\), and comparing them. A simple “diagnostic statistic” is a function, \\(g\\), of \\(a^M\\) and \\(a^D\\), such as the difference between them (though some diagnostic statistics may be a function of just one or the other). If \\(a^M\\) and \\(a^D\\) are vector valued, one might have a vector of diagnostic statistics, such as the vector of differences between each element of \\(a^M\\) and \\(a^D\\), or a scalar valued summary, such as a multidimensional distance measure. In some cases \\(a^M\\) and \\(a^D\\) might have different dimensions; for instance \\(a^D\\) may be a a pair of bounds and the diagnostic statistic is “Is \\(a^M\\) within \\(a^D\\)?” \\[ \\Gamma = g(a^M, a^D) \\] Because \\(a^M\\) and \\(a^D\\) are random variables, and any function of random variables is also a random variable, \\(\\Gamma\\) is itself a random variable. A diagnosand is a summary of that random variable. Just like we summarise random variables with statistical functionals like the expectation and variance operators, a diagnosand is a statistical functional of the diagnostic statistic random variable \\(\\Gamma\\). \\[ \\phi = f(\\Gamma) \\] Since \\(f()\\) is a statistical functional (like \\(E[]\\) or \\(V[]\\)), it is itself not a random variable. It is a description of the distribution of the random variable \\(\\Gamma\\). We’ll use the greek letter \\(\\phi\\) to describe the idea of a diagnosand in general. Let’s back up a moment to work through a concrete example of a diagnosand. Consider the diagnosand “bias”. Bias is the average difference between the estimand and the estimate. Under a model that has two potential outcomes, a treated potential outcome and an untreated potential outcome, the inquiry might be the ATE. Under a single realization \\(m\\) of the model \\(M\\), the value of the ATE will be a particular number, which we call \\(a^M\\). If our data strategy is simply to collect data on those who come to be treated versus those who don’t (i.e., we do not use random assignment), and our answer strategy is difference-in-means, our answer \\(a^D\\) could be systematically different from \\(a^M\\). The diagnostic statistic is the error \\(a^D - a^M\\); this error is a random variable because each draw of \\(m\\) from \\(M\\) is slightly different. The expectation of this random variable is \\(E[a^D - a^M]\\), which is bias. Similarly, the common diagnosand power is also an expectation. It is the expectation of the diagnostic statistic \\(\\mathbb{1}(p \\leq 0.05)\\), which is an indicator function that equals 1 if the \\(p\\)-value is below 0.05 and 0 otherwise. A key feature of this bare specification is that if \\(M\\), \\(D\\), and \\(A\\) are sufficiently well described, the answer to question \\(I\\) has a distribution \\(P_M(a^D|D)\\). Moreover, one can construct a distribution of comparisons of this answer to the correct answer, under \\(M\\), for example by assessing \\(P_M(a^M-a^D|D)\\). Some diagnosands can be calculated analytically, though most require Monte Carlo computer simulation. A main purpose of the DeclareDesign software package is making the simulation step easier. 5.0.2 Formalizing Redesign Diagnosis the process of learning the value of a diagnosand for a single design. Redesign is the process of changing parts of MIDA in order to learn how the diagnosands change. The redesign process is complete when a research selects the best (or one of the best) design among the feasible set, as measured by the changing values of the diagnosand. For example, we can compare how the distribution of errors changes if we use a different data strategy \\(D&#39;\\): \\(P_M(a^M-a^D|D&#39;)\\) or a different answer strategy \\(A&#39;\\): \\(P_M(a^M-a^{A&#39;}|D)\\). We can also hold the data and answer strategies fixed and consider the distribution of errors under an alternative model \\(M&#39;\\): \\(P_M(a^{M&#39;}-a^{A}|D)\\). In all cases, the full evaluation of a design (declaration, diagnosis, redesign) depends on the assessment of a diagnosand, and comparing the diagnoses to what could be achieved under alternative designs. 5.0.3 Brief Illustration To illustrate, consider the following design. A model M specifies three variables \\(X\\), \\(Y\\) and \\(Z\\) (all defined on the reals). These form the signature. In additional we assume functional relationships between them that allow for the possibility of confounding (for example, \\(Y = bX + Z + \\epsilon_Y; X = Z+ \\epsilon_X\\), with \\(Z, \\epsilon_X, \\epsilon_Z\\) distributed standard normal). The inquiry \\(I\\) is ``what would be the average effect of a unit increase in \\(X\\) on \\(Y\\) in the population?’’ Note that this question depends on the signature of the model, but not the functional equations of the model (the answer provided by the model does of course depend on the functional equations). Under data strategy, \\(D\\), data is gathered on \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\) for \\(n\\) randomly selected units. Answer \\(a^D\\), is then generated using ordinary least squares as the answer strategy, \\(A\\). We have specified all the components of MIDA. We now ask: How strong is this research design? One way to answer this question is with respect to the diagnosand “expected error.” Here the model’s functional equations provide an answer, \\(a^M\\) to the inquiry (for any draw of \\(\\beta\\)), and so the distribution of the expected error, given the model, \\(a^D-a^M\\), can be calculated. In this example the expected performance of the design may be poor, as measured by this diagnosand, because the data and analysis strategy do not handle the confounding described by the model. In comparison, better performance may be achieved through an alternative data strategy (e.g., where \\(D&#39;\\) randomly assigned \\(X\\) to \\(n\\) units before recording \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\)) or an alternative analysis strategy (e.g., \\(A&#39;\\) conditions on \\(Z\\)). These design evaluations depend on the model, and so one might reasonably ask how performance would look were the model different (for example if the underlying process involved nonlinearities). The central crux of good research design is generated by a deep analogy between the relationship of Models to Inquiries on the one hand and the relationship of Data Strategies to Answer Strategies on the other. \\[ M : I : : D : A \\] References "],
["specifying-the-model.html", "Chapter 6 Specifying the model", " Chapter 6 Specifying the model In this chapter, we will talk about how to go about the tricky task of specifying a \\(M\\)odel and why it is so important to do so. We are not talking about “statistical models” used to estimate unknown parameters—those are part of your answer strategy. We are talking about specifying simulation models: a set of assumptions about how your data could be generated, encoded in math or computer language, which we can use to generate imaginary datasets. The distinction is a subtle but important one. We should only trust the inferences we draw from a statistical model if we think they would be good inferences to draw based on a plausible \\(M\\)odel of how the data was generated. \\(M\\)odels often lurk where you might not expect them. When researchers do experiments, they often compare the average observed outcome in the treatment group to the average observed outcome in the control group in order to get an estimate of the average treatment effect.7 This comparison requires no statistical modelling of the distributions of the observed variables: it follows from the fact that the average difference in two potential outcomes is equal to the difference in the averages of those two potential outcomes. So it seems as though such strategies are completely agnostic as to how the data was generated. Implicit in the very definition of the average treatment effect here, however, is a \\(M\\)odel: specifically, one in which any particular draw of the random assignment is able to reveal no more than two potential outcomes for any given individual—this is sometimes referred to as a “no spillovers” assumption. But many social processes violate this assumption. If I do something differently every time you get treated and I do not, then I have at least three potential outcomes: one in which I am treated, one in which neither of us are treated, and one in which you are treated but I am not. The average observed difference-in-means across random assignments might diverge quite substantially from the average effect we are interested in (say, of putting just one person in treatment and the rest in control). So even the simplest, most agnostic research design is relying on the plausibility of an implicit \\(M\\)odel in order to generate insights that are correct on average. In practice, we never get to know whether our \\(M\\)odel is right. For example, we can never really know how many potential outcomes there are. So we also cannot know if we got the right answer. What we can do, however, is study our procedure for generating answers under \\(M\\)odels of the world that we find plausible. That way, we do get to know which answers we should and should not trust, given the assumptions we are willing to make about the world. …of putting one person in treatment and everyone else in control↩ "],
["two-languages-for-describing-causal-models.html", "6.1 Two languages for describing causal models", " 6.1 Two languages for describing causal models We make use of two different formal languages for describing causal models: DAGs and potential outcomes. DAGs are “directed acyclic graphs,” where each node on a graph is a variable and the edges that connect them represent causal effects. DAGs emphasize a mechanical notion of causality: when the exposure variable changes, the outcome variable changes as a result. By contrast, the potential outcomes formalization emphasizes a counterfactual notion of causality. \\(Y_i(0)\\) is the outcome for unit \\(i\\) when the exposure variable is set to zero and \\(Y_i(1)\\) is the outcome when it is set to one. The difference between them is the effect of the treatment on the outcome for unit \\(i\\). Since at most only one potential outcome can ever be revealed, at least one of the two potential outcomes is necessarily counterfactual. Unrevealed potential outcomes are counter-to-facts; they do not exist. Nevertheless, the potential outcomes model is useful for thinking about what would have happened had things been different. Despite what you may have inferred from the sometimes heated disagreements between scholars who prefer one formalization to the other, DAGs and potential outcomes are compatible systems for thinking about causality. A theorem in one language is a theorem in the other (CITE???). We use both languages because they are useful for expressing different facets of research design. We’ll take the example of heterogeneous treatment effects to show how the two languages convey different aspects of the research setting. 6.1.1 DAGs [ TO BE WRITTEN: initial introduction to DAGs ] 6.1.2 Potential outcomes [ TO BE WRITTEN: initial introduction to potential outcomes ] … The untreated potential outcome is written \\(Y_i(Z = 0)\\) or \\(Y_i(0)\\) for short. Likewise, \\(Y_i(Z = 1)\\) (or \\(Y_i(1)\\)) is the treated potential outcome. Notice that the potential outcomes don’t appear on the DAG – only the revealed outcome \\(Y_i\\) does. That’s because the revealed \\(Y_i\\) is the output of a causal process that switches which potential outcome is revealed depending on the level of the treatment variable. The so-called “switching equation” can be written like this: \\[ Y_i = \\begin{cases} Y_i(0) &amp; Z = control \\\\ Y_i(1) &amp; Z = treatment \\\\ \\end{cases} \\] Sometimes the switching equation is written in a more compact algebraic form: \\(Y_i = Z * Y_i(1) + (1 - Z) * Y_i(0)\\). This expression works because in the treatment condition, Z is equal to 1, so the second half of the expression is zeroed out, and \\(Y_i = Y_i(1)\\). In the control condition, Z is equal to 0, so the first half of the expression is zeroed out. This works fine for binary treatment variables, but the piecewise notation extends more naturally to additional potential outcomes (treatment 1, treatment 2, placebo, etc). The switching equation underlines the fact that at most, we can only observe the one potential outcome that happened to be revealed by the world. We either see \\(Y_i(1)\\) or \\(Y_i(0)\\), but we can never see both. This problem has famously been dubbed the “Fundamental Problem of Causal Inference” (Holland 1986). The problem is indeed fundamental and common to all causal inference settings. That said, the Fundamental Problem of Causal Inference is more severe in some settings than others. Consider the causal inference problem of measuring the average causal effect of a light switch on the lamp turning on. Suppose we flip the switch on at exactly 2020-07-08 12:33:38 EDT and the lamp illuminates. We literally can’t know whether the lamp would be on or off if the switch were in the off position at exactly that moment – that’s the Fundamental Problem of Causal Inference at work. But we can nevertheless get a good sense of the average effect of the switch on the lamp by flicking it back and forth a few times. Conditional on everything else in the system working (the electricity to the house, the lightbulb filament, etc), the average effect of the switch on illumination is 100 percentage points. The fundamental problem just isn’t a big deal in this case because we have fine control over the causal variable (the switch) and the outcome variable (is the light on?) is measured perfectly. Most social scientific research questions are much harder. Measuring the average effect of university education on earnings, for example, is a notoriously difficult research task. First, different kinds of people do and don’t attend university; those who do attend have different experiences and develop different social networks; those who don’t attend university also have heterogeneous experiences in their early careers. The Fundamental Problem of Causal Inference is quite severe in this case because it is very hard to know what the lives of well-educated offices worker would have been like had they not gone to college. 6.1.3 Complementary strengths of DAGs and potential outcomes The DAG below has just four variables. \\(Y\\) is the outcome variable. It is affected by all of the other variables: \\(Z\\), the treatment variable, \\(X\\), a pre-treatment covariate, and \\(U\\), an unobserved source of variation in both \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\). Possibly the most important thing that a DAG can teach us is which research questions are even answerable in a given seeting. Here, the causal relationship between \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\) is confounded. Since we have no information about what is in \\(U\\), we can’t learn about the effects of \\(X\\) on \\(Y\\). However, the treatment variable \\(Z\\) has no edges leading in to it, which represents the idea that \\(Z\\) is randomly assigned or otherwise exogenous. The DAG shows that even though we can’t learn about the causal effects of \\(X\\) on \\(Y\\), we can learn about average causal effects of Z on Y. We could also draw descriptive inferences about the distributions of the observed variables like their ranges and averages or their variances and covariances. This DAG conveys beliefs about whether whether two variables are causally related, but it does not encode beliefs about how they are related. The DAG doesn’t show whether the effects are positive or negative, large or small, constant or heterogeneous. For example, we can’t read from the DAG whether the average effect of \\(Z\\) should be higher or lower depending on whether \\(X\\) is set to 0 or 1. This is no criticism of DAGs – they just don’t encode all of our causal beliefs about a system. A potential outcomes representation of this same system can fill in some of the details. More specifically, we will make the two potential outcomes of \\(Y\\) with respect to \\(Z\\) explicit, since we are focused on the effects of \\(Z\\) on \\(Y\\). We will skip writing out the potential outcomes of \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\) with respect to \\(U\\) to reduce complexity, though of course the causal process by which \\(U\\) affects its descendant variables could also be represented in potential outcomes. Potential outcomes notation is especially useful for defining inquiries. Estimands are the inferential target – what we call the Inquiry in the MIDA framework. The most common estimand is the Average Treatment Effect (ATE), which is written like this8: \\[ ATE \\equiv E[Y_i(1) - Y_i(0)] \\] We want to emphasize that the ATE is an average. The difference between \\(Y_i(1)\\) and \\(Y_i(0)\\) for unit \\(i\\) is an individual-level treatment effect (sometimes we’ll refer to \\(Y_i(1) - Y_i(0)\\) as \\(\\tau_i\\)). The ATE averages over all of the individual-level treatment effects in the relevant population. Some units will have a \\(tau_i\\) that is higher than the ATE, some will have a \\(\\tau_i\\) that is lower. We emphasize this because sometimes people mistakenly thing that by focusing on an ATE, researchers are “assuming” that everyone experiences the same treatment effect. This is not true. The ATE is just a single-number summary of a possibly very heterogeneous set of responses to treatment. We can also use potential outcomes notation to define other, more complicated estimands. Throughout the book, we’ll describe a series of them – local average treatment effects, average treatment effects on the treated, average direct effects, average indirect effects, and spillover effects, to name a few – all using potential outcomes notation. In the next example, we’ll illustrate how using both DAGs and potential outcomes together, we can describe and learn about research designs in a more complete way. The DAG above encodes the beliefs that \\(Y\\) is a function of \\(Z\\), \\(X\\), and \\(U\\) and also that we can learn about the effects of \\(Z\\) on \\(Y\\) but not \\(X\\) on \\(Y\\). The DAG is silent, however, on the question of whether the effect of \\(Z\\) is on average different for units with different values of \\(X\\). In other words, the DAG doesn’t reflect beliefs about treatment effect heterogeneity. Using potential outcomes, we can write down three new estimands: the conditional average treatment effect (CATE) of \\(Z\\) on \\(Y\\) for units with \\(X = 1\\), the CATE among units with \\(X = 0\\), and the difference-in-cates: \\[ \\begin{aligned} CATE_{(X = 1)} &amp;\\equiv E[Y_i(1) - Y_i(0) | X = 1] \\\\ CATE_{(X = 0)} &amp;\\equiv E[Y_i(1) - Y_i(0) | X = 0] \\\\ Diff-in-CATEs &amp;\\equiv E[Y_i(1) - Y_i(0) | X = 1] - E[Y_i(1) - Y_i(0) | X = 0] \\end{aligned} \\] Suppose we think that the effect of treatment is larger for units with \\(X = 1\\), which is to say we think the difference-in-cates is positive. We can supplement the DAG representation of the causal model with a design declaration that includes these beliefs. diff_in_cates &lt;- 0.5 design &lt;- declare_population(N = 100, U = rnorm(N), X = rbinom(N, 1, prob = pnorm(0.5 * U + rnorm(N)))) + declare_potential_outcomes(Y ~ 0.5 * X + 0.5 * Z + diff_in_cates * X * Z + 0.5 * U) + declare_estimands( ATE = mean(Y_Z_1 - Y_Z_0), CATE_1 = mean(Y_Z_1[X == 1] - Y_Z_0[X == 1]), CATE_0 = mean(Y_Z_1[X == 0] - Y_Z_0[X == 0]), DiC = mean(Y_Z_1[X == 1] - Y_Z_0[X == 1]) - mean(Y_Z_1[X == 0] - Y_Z_0[X == 0]) ) estimand_label estimand ATE 0.725 CATE_1 1.000 CATE_0 0.500 DiC 0.500 We could incorporate different beliefs about the causal model by changing the diff_in_cates parameter. However, notice that regardless of the value of the interaction (either zero or some other number), the DAG looks the same. So if you want to design your study for the difference-in-CATEs, then you’ll need to go beyond the DAG to write down your beliefs about the extent of heterogeneity using another tool. DAGs and potential outcomes are two languages for expressing beliefs about causality. The DAG formulation emphasizes a mechanistic understanding of causal systems: if I change this here, that will (or, might) change there. The potential outcomes formulation emphasizes counterfactuals: we can either observe what happens there if I change this here or if I don’t, but not both. The two languages are useful for describing different parts of a research design. DAGs excel at describing whole causal models and indicate which variables we can learn the causal effects of. Potential outcomes are useful for precisely defining causal estimands like the ATE, the CATEs, and the difference-in-CATEs. Design declaration uses the language of potential outcomes in order to encode more specific beliefs (such as beliefs about heterogeneity) than can be represented on the DAG. The expectation operator \\(E[]\\) is a way of describing the average of a random variable. In general, \\(E[X] = \\sum_{x \\in X} x * pr(X = x)\\). Here we are slightly abusing the notation, since in a fixed population, \\(Y_i(1)\\) and \\(Y_i(0)\\) are not random variables. We could write the ATE as \\(\\frac{1}{N}\\sum_1^N Y_i(1) - Y_i(0)\\), or we could just imagine that we drawing one unit at random from the fixed population; the expectation operator can be defined with respect to this imaginary random variable in order to save ourselves some notational headaches.↩ "],

["elements-of-the-model.html", "6.3 Elements of the model", " 6.3 Elements of the model Declaring a \\(M\\)odel means specifying exogenous and endogenous variables, how they are related to one another, and the probability distributions that determine which values the variables take. That might sound hard but it does not need to be. The following line of code contains a fully specified model: An exogenous variable is one whose values do not depend on the values of any other variable in the \\(M\\)odel. Here, e is an exogenous variable: it is simply a random draw from the uniform distribution between 0 and 1, inclusive. So long as N stays fixed, no other variables influence the values that e takes on. An endogenous variable is one whose values can depend on another variable. Here, because X is defined as a function of the value that e takes, we say X is endogenous to its “parent,” e (we use the term “parent” to describe the variables that appear in the function defining an endogenous variable). The code says that the value that X takes for a given individual is equal to a random draw from a normal distribution whose mean is equal to their value of e and whose standard deviation is equal to 1. 6.3.1 Exogenous variables population &lt;- declare_population(N = 8, e = runif(N), X = rnorm(N, mean = e, sd = 1)) 6.3.2 Endogenous variables [ the endogenous relations that matter for the design are specified here; others may be in the exogenous variables ] declare_potential_outcomes() ## declare_potential_outcomes() Remember from section X that potential outcomes are the building blocks of your inquiry—they describe counterfactual states of the world that could exist, depending on some parent variable. Say the parent variable is whether you are contacted by an election campaign canvasser, who tries to convince you to vote for Jane Doe, a candidate running in your district. Then you might have at least two potential outcomes that depend on the value of this variable: whether you vote for Jane Doe when a canvasser from her campaign contacts you, on the one hand, and whether you vote for Jane Doe when that canvasser does not contact you, on the other. The difference in those two states of the world describes the treatment effect of the election campaign canvasser on whether you vote for Jane Doe. Say we did an experiment in which that canvasser visits five out of ten people who answer doors, selected at random. Then we could define the potential outcomes of the people they visit as endogenous variables: the “untreated” potential outcome of the experiment would encode whether each door-answerer would vote for Jane Doe if they were not contacted by the canvasser, and the “treated” potential ouctcome would encode whether they vote for Jane Doe if they were contacted by the canvasser. In addiiton to the untreated and treated potential outcomes of this experiment, we can add a third, distinct, variable: the vote choice that we would actually observe in an experiment where we actually assigned half of the people to canvassing. To reiterate, if a researcher wants to declare a study with two treatment conditions and no spillovers, her model will have to include at least three variables: The untreated potential outcome The treated potential outcome The observed outcome That is why DeclareDesign has a whole step devoted to declaring potential outcomes. The declare_potential_outcomes() step is crucial because it splits up endogenous variables into the counterfactual sets of values they could take, given the variables they depend on. Consider this declaration: potential_outcomes &lt;- declare_potential_outcomes(Y_Z_0 = .5 &lt; e, Y_Z_1 = .5 &lt; e + .05) Here, we have added two variables to the dataset, Y_Z_0 and Y_Z_1. They are both endogenous, in the sense that they depend on the value that e takes and on the value that Z takes.9 So Y_Z_1 is a list of the hypothetical values Y could take, if you were to set a specific variable it depends on, Z, to take the value of 1. Suppose, for example, that e represents a person’s utility from voting for Jane Doe. Then, the code says that each person will vote for Jane Doe if e is greater than .5 when they’re untreated, and if they are treated, they vote for Jane Doe when e + .05 is greater than .5. So, the \\(M\\)odel stipulates that canvassing makes people roughly five percentage points more likely to vote for Jane Doe. A variable’s potential outcomes can either be expressed by defining each potential outcome explicitly, as we do above, or through what we call a “potential outcomes function:” potential_outcomes &lt;- declare_potential_outcomes(Y ~ .5 &lt; e + .05 * Z) By default, declare_potential_outcomes() assumes that the functional equation for Y will include a binary Z that it can split on to create Y_Z_0 and Y_Z_1. But you can also tell the function to split on any other variables that take on any kind of value. For example, npotential_outcomes &lt;- declare_potential_outcomes( income ~ employed + education + u, assignment_variables = list(employed = c(&quot;No&quot;,&quot;Yes&quot;), education = c(10,12))) will create four new variables: income_employed_No_education_10, income_employed_No_education_12, income_employed_Yes_education_10, and income_employed_Yes_education_12. In this setup, income is the observed variable and the other four variables are the potential outcomes that would result from assigning individuals to the corresponding values of employed and education. The resultant function, potential_outcomes, knows not to create potential outcomes corresponding to values of u because u does not appear in the list of assignment_variables. INCLUDE HETEROGENEITY DISCUSSION HERE Careful readers may have picked up on something a bit confusing in the preceding paragraphs: we have defined potential outcomes in terms of a variable that has not yet been realized in our design. simple_design &lt;- population + potential_outcomes + estimand + sampling + assignment + reveal_outcomes + estimator The potential outcomes Y_Z_1 and Y_Z_0 are already defined in terms of Z in the second step of our design, well before the variable Z gets created in the fifth step, assignment. How is this possible? Oddly, perhaps, the values of potential outcomes do not depend on the actual values that the parent variables happen to take10—that is what makes them potential outcomes and not plain old outcomes. Imagine, for example, that your design involves assigning everyone to the control, so that \\(Z_i = 0~~\\forall~~i\\) in practice. In that case, we still define the treated potential outcome, \\(Y_i(Z_i = 1)\\), exactly as before. We do not need to know what values Z will actually take in order to define the values that Y could potentially take. What this requires at the model specification stage is some forwards-looking: you are going to need to model the imaginary states of the world that could happen before they happen. So, for example, if you have a different potential outcome depending on whether you are treated and whether you are sampled, then you need to define potential outcomes in terms of treatment assignment and sampling before either of these steps have occurred. More on this below. attrition is a PO, noncompliance is a po. these depend on D and A? 6.3.3 When you do and do not need to define potential outcomes So when should you split endogenous variables into all of the counterfactual values they can take on (potential outcomes), and when should you leave them whole? In other words, which variables belong in your population and which belong in your potential_outcomes? Why do we split on variables like Z and not on variables like u or e? The short answer is that it all depends on your \\(I\\)nquiry. Let us take a simple example using the population declaration above. Suppose that you were interested in the average effect of \\(Z\\) on \\(Y\\), for any given value that \\(X\\) can take: \\(E[Y_i(1) - Y_i(0)]\\). Then your inquiry depends only on Y_Z_1 and Y_Z_0. Those are the only potential outcomes you need. What if you want to know the effect of \\(Z\\) on \\(Y\\) among groups for whom \\(X\\) happened to equal 1 or happened to equal 0: \\(E[Y_i(1) - Y_i(0)\\mid X_i = x]\\). Here, you are not interested in the causal effect of X, just in whether, descriptively, the effect of Z on Y just happens to different among people for whom X == 1. There is no need to split on X in this case: you just need to look at the difference in Y_Z_1 and Y_Z_0 among the people for whom X is equal to 1 or to 0, which can be achieved through subsetting. Now, let us imagine that you were interested in the causal effects of both X and Z on Y. For example, you might want to know whether X causes the effects of Z on Y to be bigger: \\[E[(Y_i(Z_i = 1,X_i = 1) - Y_i(Z_i = 0,X_i = 1)) - \\] \\[~~~~~(Y_i(Z_i = 1,X_i = 0) - Y_i(Z_i = 0,X_i = 0))].\\] That is a claim about the counterfactual states of Y as a function of both variables, and would require something such as: potential_outcomes &lt;- declare_potential_outcomes( Y_X_0_Z_0 = .5 &lt; e, Y_X_0_Z_1 = .5 &lt; e + .05, Y_X_1_Z_0 = .5 &lt; e, Y_X_1_Z_1 = .5 &lt; e + .05 + .05) Where Y_X_0_Z_1, for example, is a variable that lists every individual’s potential Y outcome if X were set to 0 and Z were set to 1. In this example, we have stipulated that X increases the effect of Z by .05. To see this, note that we can rewrite the potential outcomes declaration above using a potential outcomes function: declare_potential_outcomes(Y ~ .5 &lt; e + Z * .05 + Z * X * .05, assignment_variables = list(Z = 0:1, X = 0:1)) What if the value of \\(X\\) were itself a function of \\(Z\\), and your inquiry focused on the effect of \\(X\\) on \\(Y\\)—\\(E[Y_i(X_i = 1) - Y_i(X_i = 0)]\\)? In that case, you might model two sets of potential outcomes: the potential outcomes of \\(X\\) as a function of \\(Z\\), and the potential outcomes of \\(Y\\) as a function of \\(X\\): potential_outcomes &lt;- declare_potential_outcomes( X_Z_0 = .5 &lt; e * 0.75, X_Z_1 = .5 &lt; e * 1.25, Y_X_0 = .5 &lt; e, Y_X_1 = .5 &lt; e + .05) Here, we are assuming Z is exogenous in the sense that it is randomly assigned. However, X, the causal variable of interest, is endogenous to e and to Z. In fact, if we are interested in the effect of X on Y, e is no longer background noise here as it was in the examples above: it has become a confounder of the causal effect in which we are interested . To see this, note that higher levels of e make both X and Y more likely to be TRUE. This is the sort of setup in which analysts would typically use an “instrumental variables” approach (callout to IV).11 In practice, there are always many many more potential outcomes lurking in your study than you need to model. Notice, for example, that we did not model the potential outcomes of Y as a function of specific levels of e above – unless we care about the causal effect of e on some outcome, there is little reason to model the counterfactuals it gives rise to. In the following two sections, we walk through some more concrete advice on which kinds of potential outcomes you need to consider modelling. Specifically, we think you should focus on potential outcomes generated through two processes: manipulation and interference. In DeclareDesign, potential outcomes are labelled starting with the outcome (here, Y) followed by a specific parent variable whose effect we are interested in (here, Z), and the value that parent is set to (here 1 and 0), all separated by underscores.↩ Include reference to Pearl and truncation here? E.g. \\(Pr(Y~ \\mid ~do(X)) ~~|| ~~Pr(X)\\)↩ One shortcoming of this \\(M\\)odel is that it has “baked in” the assumption of an exclusion restriction: Y is only affected by Z through Z’s effect on X—Z does not appear in the expression for Y. Returning to the fish example: showing that an instrumental variables answer strategy performs well under this \\(M\\)odel would not be convincing to someone who worried about a particular, unmodeled, violation of the exclusion restriction.↩ "],

["kinds-of-inquiries.html", "7.1 Kinds of Inquiries", " 7.1 Kinds of Inquiries There are two basic kinds of inquiries \\(I\\) about a model \\(M\\), descriptive and causal. One way to think about the difference is that descripitive inquiries are about the nodes of a dag and causal inquires are about the edges. A descriptive inference is a conclusion about a latent variable \\(Y^*\\) on the basis of a measured variable \\(Y\\). The feature we seek to describe – our inquiry – is some summary of \\(Y^*\\) like its mean or perhaps its covariance with a second latent variable \\(X^*\\). When we do descripitive research, we draw inferences about features of the nodes of the latent causal model \\(M\\). A causal inference is a conclusion about the edge between two latent variables \\(X^*\\) and \\(Y^*\\). You can’t just observe edges – you can see nodes but you can’t see edges. 7.1.1 Descriptive estimands Descriptive estimands can also require inference, not simply measurement. Simplest case level estimand: \\[X = 1\\] “Yes” An example of a descriptive estimand is: \\[E_{i\\in N}(Y)\\] \\[E_{i\\in N}(Y | X=1)\\] This descriptive estimand is to be distinguished from the counterfactual estimand: \\[\\Pr(Y=1 | X \\leftarrow 1)\\] where \\(\\leftarrow\\) is interpreted to mean that \\(X\\) is “set” to the indicated value. Moments; covariance Example of a descriptive inquiry: declare_population + declare_estimand(COV = ) 7.1.2 Causal Inquires Causal inquires are summaries that involve multiple potential outcomes. TO describe these we will imagine a simple model, in which \\(Y\\) is thought to depend on \\(X\\) and \\(M\\) and \\(M\\) in turn is thought to depend on \\(X\\). We represent this barebones model using a DAG in figure ??. [Note, this section has a huge jumble of letters that will need to be harmonized!] Causal inquiries like the average effect of A on B in a causal model like \\(A -&gt; B &lt;- U\\) are helped enormously by good descriptive inference about the nodes \\(A\\) and \\(B\\), but the focus is on the edge between them. You typically can’t learn about the edge by doing desscripitve inference on the nodes only. If we measure \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) and find that they covary, we can’t be sure that \\(A -&gt; B\\) because it could be that \\(A &lt;- U -&gt; B\\). This problem goes by the familiar phrase that “correlation doesn’t imply causation,” which is true and is a problem that can’t be wished away. But “correlation doesn’t imply causation” also kind of misses the point. The point is that you can’t see causality because it involves counterfactuals, which are imaginary and unseen. You have to infer causality on the basis of design. Mediation Inquires: Consider \\(X -&gt; B &lt;- A\\) and \\(X -&gt; A\\). In this DAG \\(A\\) is a mediator. There are three causal inquiries: \\(X -&gt; B\\) \\(X -&gt; A\\) \\(A -&gt; B\\). If we randomize \\(X\\), we can learn about \\(X -&gt; A\\) but not \\(X -&gt; B\\), because \\(X -&gt; B\\) is confounded. We obviously don’t learn anything about \\(A -&gt; B\\) because for that we’d need to randomize \\(A\\). Mediation analysis tries to get all three for the price of one random assignment. At best we get \\(X -&gt; A\\) and the total effect of X on B, which is not just \\(X -&gt; B\\), but instead \\(X -&gt; B\\) + \\((X -&gt; A) * (A -&gt; B)\\). Mediation analysis tries to get something for nothing.

Social scientists are picking research questions it can be hard to know where to start. Theory is imaginary. We have to to spend time imagining it. That’s what theorists do (with different formalizations). The imagine models (\\(M\\)). Models are complex, there are many things to know about them, that is, there are many inquiries. Data are real. We have to spend time making them. That’s what empiricists do (with many different measurement procedures). They make data real by creating them. Data come in many forms, there are many things to know about creating data. There are many ways to summarize them. Empiricists have to be concerned about research design. We have to develop empirical strategies to demonstrate \\(I\\). We have to learn a lot about how to select the date of strategy and the answer strategy in a way that demonstrates an inquiry about a model that anybody cares about. So empiricists have to learn about models and inquiries (theory) as well as about data strategies and answer strategies (empirics). The sine qua non of a good research question (\\(I\\)) is that there is a feasible design (\\(MIDA\\)) that could answer it. That means picking a good question \\(I\\) does not just involve theory. Ofcourse, you should study \\(M\\) to understand which \\(I\\)s are worth knowing. But you should also study \\(D\\) and \\(A\\) in order to learn how to demonstrate \\(I\\). It can be a difficult mapping, but we think to get started it’s helpful to – at a minimum – write down the \\(M\\) and \\(I\\) of any causal model that interests you to get started thinking about selecting strong \\(D\\)s and \\(A\\)s. The goal is to learn how to map \\(I(M)\\) to \\(A(D)\\). Then return to theory to find new important inquiries, then write down a new model inquiry data strategy and answer strategy. This process is how we make progress on \\(M\\), that is, we bring \\(M\\) closer to \\(W\\), thereby making \\(M\\) truer. A good inquiry is informative about the model. - Existence of a node (descriptive mean) - Model suggests two variables should be correlated (descriptive correlation) - Arrow between a node (experiment) - CDF / PDF of a variable A bad inquiry: - does not exist - does not address a “central” part of the model - does not summarize the theory You are responsible for your inquiry.

I want there to be some advice because I don’t want to punt, but I know this advice will have to change.] Since there are so many things we don’t know about the social world, researchers are positively overbrimming with interesting theories to test. Then again, most of us are a little bit bewildered when it comes to actually formulating a research question that would simultaneously be worth knowing the answer to and that would be feasible to answer. This section considers and critiques some common research question formulation advice. Perhaps unsurprising, our overarching perspective is that we can’t compromise on research design – scientific conclusions depend essentially on strong research designs. That said, choosing research questions is much more art than science. Moreover, the choice of what to study is not valueless in the sense that scholars’ research agendas are reflections of their values and their politics. While scientists seek to reveal objective truths, we also have to choose which truths to investigate, and that choice is value-laden. 7.3.1.1 The false choice between theory-first and method-first approaches. Some research questions are boring and trivial – no doubt you have encountered such research questions when reading bad research. Figuring our the best way to answer unimportant questions can be a stimulating intellectual puzzle, but the answers to those questions themselves will not advance scientific knowledge. Some research questions are exciting and vital – those are the ones we want to answer using credible research designs. Giving weak or noncredible answers to important research questions is dangerous and unethical. Sometimes scholarly debate about research design treat these two desiderata (good questions and strong designs) as forming a one-dimensional spectrum. To the left we have boring studies done well and to the right we have interesting studies with weak empirics. This “spectrum” view manufactures a tradeoff between the quality of the question and the strength of the research design. It tricks students into thinking that they have to make compromises on the research design (i.e., control for enough things and hope for the best) in order to do great things. The reality is that research is hard and sometimes it is so hard that we must abandon them. Good questions might be too damn hard to answer and we must deliberately walk away from them even though they are interesting. Bad questions aren’t worth the effort, even if they are feasible – walk away from them too. Both interesting questions and strong research designs to answer them are required. Advice about how to solve this dilemma often takes one of two forms: theory-first approaches and method-first approachs. Under the theory-driven approach, you read a lot of others’ work in order to formulate a good research question; you then search among the available methods to find the “right” method for the question. This approach is risky because it is very hard to abandon a good research questions, even if none of the available methods is good enough. The worst case scenario for the theory-first is a research process that takes forever, scholars falling prey to the sunk cost fallacy and falling to abandon a hopeless project, and a final research project that relies on heroic assumptions and makes no real progress on the interesting research question. The method-first approach involves learning a method well first, then looking for interesting projects to apply it to later. This frequently means practicing the method for the method’s sake. To become an expert interviewer, you must conduct many interviews. To become an expert experimentalist, you must randomize many treatments. To become an expert observational data analyst, you must download many datasets and develop a sense for when inferences are reliable and when they are not. The worst-case scenario for the method-first approach is that scholars never stop practicing research to actually finally conduct research on important topics. What good is it to be a top-flight archivist if those skills are never applied to good questions. Obviously, a mix of the two approaches is required, and most of variation in advice given to young scholars isn’t just one or the other, but the relative weight given to the two. As a team of authors, we disagree amongst ourselves about the right weights. That said, the downsides to boring but well-done research don’t seem as bad to us as the downsides of interesting but poorly-done research. Bad studies on important questions are used by disingenous and bad faith actors to push for policies that are bad for society. The ethical stakes are higher for important questions than they are for unimportant questions. For that reason alone, we think it is vitally important that researchers master their methods so as to assiduously avoid making unknowably incorrect claims. People who are looking in the forest for mushrooms often don’t see a mushroom for a long period of time. After a while, they acclimate. They get their ``eyes on,’’ and successful finds seem to be around every bend. In this analogy, the theory building process is going for a walk in the forest and methods training is learning to spot mushrooms – you need get your eyes on answerable research questions worth answering. In our experience, that means that the most important thing for young scholars to do is practice. Practice both searching for interesting questions and practice research design. Practicing research design often involves honing one’s skills on less than interesting questions. Looking for interesting questions entails reading other scholars’ work carefully and generously. Even when their research designs are not strong, their questions might nevertheless be interesting. You may learn from reading bad work on interesting questions that some research questions are impossible to answer. That’s OK – now you’ve learned about the constraints on what we can learn. Operating within the constraints of what is knowable means you can anticipate when a poor research design on an interesting question is unlikely to lead to progress. 7.3.1.2 Novelty Another route for finding research questions is to try to determine what is unknown to the research community, then to seek to fill that gap. This approach can be quite generative, but it is not without pitfalls. Establishing primacy – that a finding is “new” and that the knowledge generated by the study was previously unknown – is hard. It’s also risky, since peer reviewers have access to Google Scholar. False primacy claims are especially damaging during the review process because they are easily refuted and demonstrate ignorance of the published record. What does it mean for a research finding to be novel? There are two main cases. First, a finding is new if the empirical pattern was predicted by an earlier theory but had yet to be confirmed. That is, there was a theoretical prediction that had not yet found its empirical verification. The empirical finding is novel in that it confirms the previously unconfirmed theoretical prediction. Second, an empirical finding is also novel if the empirical reality was not predicted by the theory. If the empirical funding is trustworthy, it means that the original theory is incomplete or incorrect in a particular way. Findings that contradict theoretical predictions are also novel. Empirical findings are not novel when the theoretical predictions that pertain to the finding have already been well-documented. This puts the advance of science in a funny position. Because we are worried that many of the advances made at the forefront of the scientific endeavor are incorrect or spurious, we really value replication of novel results. When an empirical claim in favor of a theoretical proposition is made in Place A at Time 1, we immediately want to know if it holds at Place B at Time 2 as well. 7.3.1.3 Mixing methods A common piece of advice for young scholars who are interested in a topic is to mix methods. The thinking goes like this: I have an important question but none of my methods perfectly answers the question. I’ll take a multifaceted approach that gets that many different aspects of the question which I hope to aggregate into a whole. We caution against this approach. Mastering one method is difficult; mastering three is very difficult. Even when mastery of the methods is not an obstacle, the problem that often occurs is that the three research designs actually address different research questions. That is, not only do the three research designs use different data strategies and answer strategies, they also employ different models and inquiries. As a result, mixed methods work often gives three incomplete answers to three related, but ultimately different, research questions. 7.3.1.4 Things to incorporate “model” inquiries in which I’m trying to rule out some Ms. Process tracing is "],
["crafting-a-data-strategy.html", "Chapter 8 Crafting a data strategy", " Chapter 8 Crafting a data strategy The data strategy is what researchers do in the world in order to collect information about it. Depending on the design, it could include decisions about any or or all of the following: how to sample or select cases, how to assign treatments, or how to measure outcomes. These choices apply to all kinds of research. In experimental research, a large focus is given to the assignment of treatments. How many treatment conditions should there be? Should we use a simple coin flip to decide who recieves treatment, or should we use a more complicated strategy like blocking? Experimenters are of course also very concerned with sampling and measurement procedures, but it is the random assignment to treatments that make experiments distinctive among research designs. Quantitative descriptive research, on the other hand, often has an inquiry like the population average of some outcome variable. Since the goal here is to draw inferences about a population on the basis of a sample, we need to pay special attention to the procedure by which units are selected into the sample. We might use a random sampling procedure in order to generate a design-based justification for generalizing from samples to population. Nonrandom sampling procedures are also possible: convenience sampling, respondent-driven sampling, and snowball sampling are all data strategies that do not include an explictly random component. Once we have selected units into the sample, we need to measure them in some way. The tools we use to measure are a critical part of the data strategy. For many social scientific studies, a main way we collect information is through surveys. A huge methodological literature on survey administration has developed to help guide researchers who have to design questionnaires. Bad survey questions yield distorted or noisy responses. They can be distored if responses are systematically biased away from the true latent target the question is designed to measure, in which case the question has low validity. They can be noisy if (hypothetically) you would obtain different answers each time you asked the same person the same question, in which case the question has low reliability. Beyond surveys, we might use administrative data to collect outcomes. The concerns about validity and reliability do not disappear once we move out of the survey environment. The information that shows up in an administrative database is itself the result of many human decisions, each of which has the possibility of increasing or decreasing the distance between the measurement and the thing to be measured. Researchers have to choose good sampling, assignment, and measurement techniques that, when combined and applied to the world, will produce information that is ready for analysis. We will discuss answer strategies – the set of analysis choices about what to do with the data once it’s collected – in the next chapter. The data and answer strategies are of course intimately interconnected. How you analyze data depends deeply on how it was collected and how you collect data depends just as deeply on how you plan to analyze it. For the moment, we are thinking through the many choices we might make as part of the data strategy, but of course they will have to be considered in concert with the answer strategy in any applied research design setting. The data strategy is a set of procedures that result in a dataset. It is important to keep these two concepts straight. If you apply data strategy \\(D\\), it produces dataset \\(d\\). The data \\(d\\) is the result of the data strategy \\(D\\). We say \\(d\\) is “the” result of \\(D\\), since when we apply the data strategy to the world, we only do so once and we obtain the data that we obtain. But when we are crafting a data strategy, we have to think about the many datasets that the data strategy could have produced. Some of the datasets might be really excellent. For example, in good datasets, we achieve good covariate balance across the treatment and control groups. Or we might draw a sample whose distribution of observable characteristics looks really similar to the population. But some of the datasets might be worse: because of the vagaries of randomization, the particular realizations of the random assignment or random sampling might more more or less balanced. We do not have to settle for data strategies that can produce worse datasets! We want to choose data strategy \\(D\\) that is likely to result in a high-quality dataset \\(d\\). "],

["choosing-an-answer-strategy.html", "Chapter 9 Choosing an answer strategy", " Chapter 9 Choosing an answer strategy Answer strategies \\(A\\) are the full set of procedures you use to map the data generated by the data strategy (\\(d\\)) to the eventual estimate \\(a^D\\). This same principle applies to all empirical research, regardless of whether the inquiry is causal or descriptive, whether the data strategy is observational or experimental, and whether the answer strategy itself is fundamentally qualitative or quantitative. Consider a randomized experiment that seeks to estimate the causal effect of a treatment. The answer strategy is not just “Logistic Regression with Covariate adjustment”. It includes every step in the process that takes the raw data, cleans and recodes it, considers 5 alternative estimators (DIM, OLS with covariate adjustment, a fancy thing your colleague suggested but you couldn’t get to converge), before finally settling on logit. Consider a qualtitive research design (cite and gloss VESLA’s PORTALS PROJECT). The answer strategy is not just “describe common themes in the interview transcripts.” It involves manual coding of many discovered features of the transcripts, then counting the frequency of those features, then describing those features within an analytic framework with the best examples from the corpus. If the interviews had come out differently (i.e. if \\(d\\) had been different), then every step in the process would be different as well. With data in hand you need to have a procedure to develop an answer or a decision from it. The result of an answer strategy is a quantitative or qualitative estimate that provides an answer to one of the inquiries in your design. An answer strategy is, conceptually, a function that produces that an estimate from data. A simple answer strategy is a difference-in-means between the outcomes in a treatment group and the outcomes in a control group, which we select as an estimator of the true average treatment effect, the mean difference in potential outcomes under treatment and potential outcomes under control. Another answer strategy is the average answer to a survey question about support for a politician among 500 respondents from a random sample of the country, which is an estimate for the inquiry ``what is the average support for the politician in the country.’’ In addition to an estimate, we also commonly produce measures of uncertainty in our estimates and statistics related to hypothesis testing. These are also part of the answer strategy: we want to know our best guess answer to the inquiry, and also how certain we are in our answer. We may want to test a hypothesis to provide a “yes” or “no” decision in response to an inquiry. Regression software commonly returns an estimate, estimated standard error, test statistic, p-value, and confidence interval. There are also a set of procedures we use to return an answer to our inquiry that fall outside of this common set of estimation procedures. The answer to our inquiry is found in a set of procedures to select a final estimators, the ways we report on and interpret the estimates visually and in writing, and the ancillary analyses we conduct to build confidence in the main estimates (i.e., robustness checks). When the data strategy does not go according to plan, and for example participants do not comply with assigned treatments or respond to survey questions, the set of alternative analyses to adjust for these problems are also part of the answer strategy. If the analysis strategy depends on how the data turn out, we need to assess the if-then analysis procedure under different possible realizations of the data to know if the procedure is a good one. The answer strategy provides an answer to the inquiry about the model using data that result from the data strategy. But as we have seen, the choice of answer strategy is also intimately connected to our causal model of the world, to the inquiry about the model, and to our chosen data strategy. Our model helps guide our choices about what variables to control for — and which controls would lead to bias. Our inquiry can shape our choices about which subsets of the data to analyze and how to weight them. And our data strategy can shape the estimators and standard errors we use in our answer strategy depending on how we stratified samples and treatment assignments. "],
["large-classes-of-answer-strategies.html", "9.1 Large Classes of Answer Strategies", " 9.1 Large Classes of Answer Strategies [Text here to explain the difference between qual and quant] [Note to self: learn the difference between qual and quant] 9.1.1 Qualtitative Answer Strategies [This section should focus on really bringing qual into the fold – not sure how] 9.1.2 Quantitative Answer Strategies The first choice in an answer strategy is to choose how you will construct your estimate for the inquiry. There are two established principles for selecting among possible estimation procedures, which apply both for qualitative and quantitative designs. The first is to draw on your model to learn what variables to select a conditioning strategy that avoids blocks back-door paths and does not condition on colliders. The second is to analyze your data according to your data strategy, accounting for how you stratified your data and the probabilities of sampling and assignment to avoid bias. A third principle highlighted by the MIDA structure is that your inquiry will also necessarily guide answer strategy choices. With an identical model and data strategy, the analysis strategy to target the sample average and the population average as inquiries would implies two different analysis strategies. With an estimator in mind, the second task in choosing an answer strategy is describing uncertainty. In many cases, this will mean selecting an estimator for the standard error of the estimate and a method for constructing a confidence interval. The choice of standard error estimator is parallel to the choice of estimator: there is a true standard error of any estimator-estimand pair, and we want a standard error estimator with low bias and high precision. However, in trading off bias and variance in standard error estimators, we often tend to choose estimators that are conservative. Choosing a conservative estimator implies a scientific or moral preference for avoiding overconfidence in our estimates. The data strategy will often shape the choice of standard error estimator: how likely a given estimate is will be a function of features of the model, but also the probability of a given treatment assignment or sample. In addition to an estimate and measure of uncertainty in it, we often need to construct a hypothesis test about the estimate in order to provide an answer to an inquiry. If the inquiry is of the form, “is the proportion of voters who support the candidate greater than half” or “is the treatment effect positive”, this implies a hypothesis test that provides a “yes” or “no” answer based on the data. The inquiry guides the choice of null hypothesis. Then a hypothesis testing framework, such as null-hypothesis testing or equivalence testing. The data strategy may also shape the choice of hypothesis testing method. Permutation inference a.k.a. randomization inference is a method for testing sharp null hypotheses implied by a particular sampling and/or treatment assignment procedure without relying on asymptotic inference. We declare an answer strategy with an estimator for the average treatment effect and its standard error and a method for constructing confidence intervals and a null hypothesis as follows, using linear regressions: declare_estimator(Y ~ Z + covariate, model = lm, term = &quot;Z&quot;, estimand = &quot;ATE&quot;) This declaration asserts a choice about the model (linear regression using the built-in lm function), the functional form (linear terms for the treatment variable and a covariate), selects the coefficient of interest that forms our estimate (Z), and links that estimate to an estimate (“ATE”). The result is: estimator_label term estimate std.error statistic p.value conf.low conf.high estimand_label estimator Z 1 0 Inf 0 1 1 ATE "],
["answer-strategies-as-procedures.html", "9.2 Answer Strategies as Procedures", " 9.2 Answer Strategies as Procedures Multiple estimates. Answer strategies can account how many statistical tests you are conducting. Often, when generating an answer to a single inquiry, we may construct multiple estimates that provide different types of answers of varying quality. When you present the results from many null hypothesis tests, the rate of falsely rejecting at least one of those tests even when all are true goes up, due to the multiple comparisons problem. If you plan to adjust for this problem, those adjustments are part of your answer strategy, because they will typically adjust the p-values you report and the decisions readers make with them. We may have three survey items that imperfectly estimate a latent quantity. In presenting the results, we could present three estimates from three regressions, we could adjust the three estimates using a procedure such as a family-wise error rate correction, or we could average the three items together into an index and present one estimate from one regression. Which of these three methods we select will change the properties of our answer strategy. Analysis procedures. The final estimator that goes into a paper is neither the beginning nor the end of the answer strategy. Procedures, if any, by which you explore the data and determine a final set of estimates are part of the answer strategy. Procedures for summarizing multiple estimates are one example of many. Commonly, the final estimator that is selected depended on a exploratory procedure in which multiple models are assessed, for example by comparing model fit statistics. The answer strategy of our research design is not to fit the final model — is it this multiple step if-then procedure. These procedures may be part of a prespecified analysis plan or they may be informal, so it may sometimes only be possible to declare the full design after the data is obtained. (We may find that a different analysis procedure that was not data dependent would have been preferable, if we diagnose the design after the fact.) The reason to declare the procedure rather than the final estimator is that the diagnosis of the design may differ. The procedure may be more powerful, if for example we assessed multiple sets of covariate controls and selecting the specification with the lowest standard error of the estimate. But the procedure may also exhibit poor coverage, accounting for these multiple bites at the apple. We also sometimes find that the model we planned to run to analyze the data cannot be estimated. In these cases, there is an iterative estimation procedure in which a first model is run, changes to the specification are made, and a second or third model is presented as the result. The full set of steps — a decision tree, depending on what is estimable — is the answer strategy and we can evaluate whether it is a good one not only under the realized data but under other possible realizations where the decision tree would be the same but the decisions different. In fact, there are examples of analysis procedures in most types of research, quantitative or qualitative. Many strategies for causal inference with observational data involve not only an estimation strategy but a set of falsification or placebo tests. The answer provided by these research designs depends in a crucial way on the results of these tests: if the tests fail, the design provides no definitive answer. In qualitative research, process tracing involves a set of steps, the results of which depend on information gathered in earlier steps. Many mixed methods strategies are also multi-step procedures. Nested designs involve running a quantitative analysis and then selecting cases on the basis of predictions from the regression. These designs cannot be assessed by considering a single step of the procedure in isolation. We demonstrate the fact that the properties of procedures differ from the properties of a design with the final estimator in a simple example. We compare two possible estimation specifications, with and without covariates, to a procedure in which we run both models and report the model in our paper that has the lower p-value. The models are exactly the same, but the properties of the procedure differ from the properties of either of the two possible models. In particular, the procedure has higher power than either of the two models, but it exhibits poor coverage, which means we have a bias in our measure of uncertainty. report_lower_p_value &lt;- function(data){ fit_nocov &lt;- lm_robust(Y ~ Z, data) fit_cov &lt;- lm_robust(Y ~ Z + X, data) # select fit with lower p.value on Z if(fit_cov$p.value[2] &lt; fit_nocov$p.value[2]){ fit_selected &lt;- fit_cov } else { fit_selected &lt;- fit_nocov } fit_selected %&gt;% tidy %&gt;% filter(term == &quot;Z&quot;) } design &lt;- declare_population( N = 100, X = rbinom(N, 1, 0.5), u = rnorm(N) ) + declare_potential_outcomes(Y ~ 0.25 * Z + 10 * X + u) + declare_estimand(ATE = mean(Y_Z_1 - Y_Z_0)) + declare_assignment(prob = 0.5) + declare_reveal(Y, Z) + declare_estimator(Y ~ Z, model = lm_robust, label = &quot;nocov&quot;, estimand = &quot;ATE&quot;) + declare_estimator(Y ~ Z, model = lm_robust, label = &quot;cov&quot;, estimand = &quot;ATE&quot;) + declare_estimator( handler = label_estimator(report_lower_p_value), label = &quot;select-lower-p-value&quot;, estimand = &quot;ATE&quot;) diags &lt;- diagnose_design(design, sims = sims) design_label estimand_label estimator_label term bias se(bias) rmse se(rmse) power se(power) coverage se(coverage) mean_estimate se(mean_estimate) sd_estimate se(sd_estimate) mean_se se(mean_se) type_s_rate se(type_s_rate) mean_estimand se(mean_estimand) n_sims design ATE cov Z -0.0391521 0.3187862 1.0709462 0.1882101 0.0 0.0000000 0.9 0.0814267 0.2108479 0.3187862 1.1281218 0.2020015 1.0110888 0.0060038 NaN NA 0.25 0 10 design ATE nocov Z -0.0391521 0.3187862 1.0709462 0.1882101 0.0 0.0000000 0.9 0.0814267 0.2108479 0.3187862 1.1281218 0.2020015 1.0110888 0.0060038 NaN NA 0.25 0 10 design ATE select-lower-p-value Z -0.0786048 0.2198892 0.8416431 0.1976769 0.4 0.1596049 0.7 0.1468043 0.1713952 0.2198892 0.8832921 0.2088199 0.4337737 0.0954157 0 NA 0.25 0 10 Robustness checks are part of the answer strategy. Often, a single estimator is presented as the main analysis but then a series of alternative specifications are displayed in an appendix (such as including or excluding covariates and their interactions, different subsets of the data, or alternative statistical models). These differ from multiple estimates of a latent quantity in that the goal is not a primary analysis, but rather to support the main analysis. The purpose is to provide readers with evidence about how dependent the main results are on the specification, data subset, and statistical model used. The decision a reader makes from a paper depends not only on the main estimate but also the robustness checks. As a result, we want to assess the properties of the two together. We illustrate with a simple analysis of the correlation between two variables y1 and y2, who have a true positive correlation. y2 is also a function of an observed covariate x and measurement error. Our main analysis is a bivariate regression predicting y2 with y1. We compare this answer strategy to one in which we run that analysis, but also run a robustness check controlling for x. We do this because as the analyst we are unsure of the true DGP and wish to demonstrate to reviewer’s that our results are not dependent on the functional form we choose. bivariate_correlation_decision &lt;- function(data) { fit &lt;- lm_robust(y2 ~ y1, data) %&gt;% tidy %&gt;% filter(term == &quot;y1&quot;) tibble(decision = fit$p.value &lt;= 0.05) } interacted_correlation_decision &lt;- function(data) { fit &lt;- lm_robust(y2 ~ y1 + x, data) %&gt;% tidy %&gt;% filter(term == &quot;y1&quot;) tibble(decision = fit$p.value &lt;= 0.05) } robustness_check_decision &lt;- function(data) { main_analysis &lt;- bivariate_correlation_decision(data) robustness_check &lt;- interacted_correlation_decision(data) tibble(decision = main_analysis$decision == TRUE &amp; robustness_check$decision == TRUE) } robustness_checks_design &lt;- declare_population( N = 100, x = rnorm(N), y1 = rnorm(N), y2 = 0.15 * y1 + 0.01 * x + rnorm(N) ) + declare_estimand(y1_y2_are_related = TRUE) + declare_estimator(handler = label_estimator(bivariate_correlation_decision), label = &quot;bivariate&quot;) + declare_estimator(handler = label_estimator(robustness_check_decision), label = &quot;robustness-check&quot;) decision_diagnosis &lt;- declare_diagnosands(correct = mean(decision == estimand), keep_defaults = FALSE) diag &lt;- diagnose_design(robustness_checks_design, sims = sims, diagnosands = decision_diagnosis) We evaluate the two answer strategies in terms of the rate of correctly deciding there is a correlation between y2 and y1. In the main analysis, this means we judge there is a correlation when the p-value is below \\(0.05\\). In our robustness check answer strategy, we decide there is a correlation when both the main analysis and the robustness check return p-values below \\(0.05\\) on the coefficient on y1. We see that we are more likely to correctly judge there is a correlation in the simpler analysis strategy. This is because we added an additional criterion to our decision; both criteria, due to random noise, sometimes fail to reject the null of no correlation. Our second answer strategy is more robust in the sense that we have stronger evidence of a correlation when we run the two analyses together. But we are also less likely to decide (correctly) that there is a relationship. The robustness check is conservative. This exercise highlights that the properties of an answer strategy with secondary analyses will be different than the properties of the main analysis alone. If we planned (or conducted) robustness checks, we may wish to know how good the pair of strategies is together. Using the MIDA way of thinking about designs, we discuss in the diagnosis section another notion of the “robustness” of a design. The typical way we think of robustness checks is multiple secondary analyses conditional on the observed data to build confidence in an analysis of that fixed data. However, the motivation for these robustness checks is uncertainty about the true data generating process. By declaring a design in terms of MIDA, we can think about the robustness of a single estimator to multiple possible true data generating processes. An estimator that is robust in this sense is one that is unbiased with low uncertainty regardless of, say, the true functional form between y1 and y2. To determine whether an estimator is robust, we can redefine a set of designs with different functional forms and assess the rate of correct decisions of our robustness checks strategy under each different model. How answers are presented. How results are presented in tables and figures is an important part of the answer strategy. Considerable attention has been paid to how to display data, including arguments for switching from tables to graphs as the primary way to present statistical models (Kastellec) and for visually present raw data and models together (Coppock). The reason for this attention is that what inferences readers make when reading a paper depends not only on the statistical procedures used for estimation but the medium in which they are displayed. When numerical estimates are not provided at all, and only visualizations of results, clearly aesthetic choices about which estimates are displayed and even the width of axes will determine what the reader takes away from the answer strategy. This principle applies not just to tables and visualizations; how we describe results in the text of a paper also shapes readers’ inferences from the data. Registered reports are a format for preparing scientific papers that involves prespecifying not only the form of graphs and tables but the text the author plans to write depending on the results. In short, decisions made from your results by readers are not just a function of numerical estimates but how they are presented. We explore this claim by comparing two possible graphical displays of conditional avareage treatment effects in an experiment. A common presentational format is to present the average treatment effect in one group and then the other along with confidence intervals. Inferences are made — either by the author, or by readers — as a function of whether one is significant and not the other. If that is true, the inference is that there is a difference in CATEs. An alternative is to present the estimated difference along with the two effects. The inferences can then directly be based on whether the confidence interval of the difference crosses zero. We illustrate these two visual answer strategies below: We now demonstrate that the answer strategy on the left is flawed. XXYY describe sims. When things do not go according to plan. To compare answer strategies, you can imagine the estimators that are possible if things go well as well as if things go wrong, when there is missing data or there are outliers in variables. A good answer strategy, which might be a single estimator, or a procedure if-this-then-that, can handle both states of the world. Procedures for addressing deviations from expected analyses are part of the answer strategy. Even in the absence of a preanalysis plan, we often have a way we expect to analyze the data if things go well. When they do not — because data are missing, there is noncompliance with an intervention, or the study is suspended for example — the answers will change. These procedures determine the answer the study provides (or in some cases does not), so are part of the answer strategy. Standard operating procedures (lin and green) are documents that systematize these procedures in advance. "],

["diagnosing-a-design.html", "10.1 Diagnosing a design", " 10.1 Diagnosing a design Research diagnosis is two steps: simulating running a design over and over, and a quantitative summary of runs of the design. Diagnosis is the process of evaluating the properties of a research design. Since “property of a research design” is a cumbersome phrase, we made up the word “diagnosand” to refer to those properties of a research design we would like to diagnose. Many diagnosands are familiar. Power is the probability of obtaining a statistically significant result. Bias is the average deviation of estimates from the true value of the estimand. Others are more exotic, like the Type-S error rate, which is the probability the estimate has the incorrect sign, conditional on being statistically significant (Gelman and Carlin 2014). Not every diagnosand is relevant for every study. For example, in a descriptive study whose goal is to estimate the fraction of people in France who are left-handed, statistical power is irrelevant. A hypothesis test against the null hypothesis that 0 percent of the people in France are left-handed is preposterous. We know for sure that the fraction is not zero, we just don’t know its precise value. A much more important diagnosand for this study would be RMSE (root-mean-squared-error), which is a measure of how well-measured the estimand that incorporates both bias and variance. How should you choose your diagnosands? In our experience, writing out what would make the study either a success or a failure helps tremendously. If a successful study would yield an estimate that is higher than 4, has a standard error of 1 or less, and in which we find statistically significant evidence of treatmnet effect heterogeneity – write down a diagnosand that is the probability of all three of those conditions being true at the same time. If a study is a failure (in terms of not having been worth the money and effort ex post) when the confidence interval is 20 points wide or wider, then the research team should design to minimize the probability of that occurance.

["estimating-diagnosands-analytically.html", "10.2 Estimating diagnosands analytically", " 10.2 Estimating diagnosands analytically Research design diagnosis can be done analytically. Indeed, research design textbooks often contain many formulas for calculating power under a variety of designs. For example, Gerber and Green include the following power formula: They write: “To illustrate a power analysis, consider a completely randomized experiment where \\(N&gt;2\\) of \\(N\\) units are selected into a binary treatment. The researcher must now make assumptions about the distributions of outcomes for treatment and for control units. In this example, the researcher assumes that the control group has a normally distributed outcome with mean \\(\\mu_c\\), the treatment group has a normally distributed outcome with mean \\(\\mu_t\\), and both group’s outcomes have a standard deviation \\(\\sigma\\). The researcher must also choose \\(\\alpha\\), the desired level of statistical significance (typically 0.05). Under this scenario, there exists a simple asymptotic approximation for the power of the experiment (assuming that the significance test is two-tailed): \\[ \\beta = \\Phi \\bigg(\\frac{|\\mu_t - \\mu_c| \\sqrt{N}}{2\\sigma} - \\Phi^{-1} (1 - \\frac{\\alpha}{2}) \\bigg) \\] where \\(\\beta\\) is the statistical power of the experiment, \\(\\Phi(\\cdot)\\) is the normal cumulative distribution function (CDF), and \\(\\Phi^{-1}(\\cdot)\\) is the inverse of the normal CDF.” See how this power formula makes specific assumptions about \\(M\\), \\(D\\), and \\(A\\)? Under \\(M\\), it assumes that the potential outcomes are both normally distributed with group specific means and a common variance. Under \\(D\\), it assumes a particular randomization strategy. Under \\(A\\), it assumes a particular hypothesis testing approach (equal variance t-test with \\(N - 2\\) degrees of freedom). This set of assumptions may be “close enough” in many research settings, but it can be difficult to understand the specific impacts of different beliefs about \\(M\\), \\(D\\) and \\(A\\) on the value of the diagnosand. What if instead of being normally distributed, the potential outcomes are measured in 1 - 5 Likert scales? What if the randomization procedure includes blocking? What if we include covariates in our treatment effect estimation approach? Formulas for some large sources of design variation have been derived (such as clustering), but certainly not for every design variant. Very quickly, hope for analytic design diagnosis fades. The analytic formulas are abstractions – they abstract away from design details and sometimes those design details are important. This problem is not confined to the “power” diagnosand. In randomized experiments, claims about the bias diagnosand are quite general. Many randomized designs are unbiased for the ATE, but not all. Designs that encounter noncompliance, attrition, or some forms of spillover may not be unbiased for the ATE. Even without any of those complications, cluster randomized trials with heteogeneous cluster sizes are not unbiased (joel, imai). Diagnosands depend on design details, because how you conduct you conduct your study matters for its properties. That means design diagnosis must be design-aware. Since designs are so heteogenous and can vary on so many dimensions, computer simulation is only feasible way to characterize any study but the most ideal-type designs (assuming normality and ignoring heterogeneity) in the simplest of terms (power, bias, variance, but nothing further).

In order to assess whether researchers have conducted enough simulations to be confident in their diagnosand estimates, we recommend estimating the sampling distributions of the diagnosands via the nonparametric bootstrap.12 With the estimated diagnosand and its standard error, we can characterize our uncertainty about whether the range of likely values of the diagnosand compare favorably to reference values such as statistical power of \\(0.8\\).13 Graphic of simulations (of multiple runs) must do a TYPE S error rate histogram with three areas.

["design-library.html", "Chapter 13 Design Library", " Chapter 13 Design Library This section of the book enumerates a series of common social science research designs. Each entry will include description of the design in terms of MIDA and also a declaration of the design in code. We’ll often diagnose designs over the range of values of some design parameters in order to point out especially interesting or unusual features of the design. Our goal in this section is not to provide a comprehensive accounting of all empirical research designs. It’s also not to describe any of the particular designs in exhaustive detail, because we are quite sure that in order for these designs to be useful for any practical purpose, they will need to be modified. The entries in the design library are not recipes that, if you follow the instructions, out will come high-quality research. Instead, we hope that the entries provide inspiration for how to tailor a particular class of designs – the blocked-and-clustered randomized trial or the catch-and-release design – to your own research setting. The basic structure of the design library entry will be useful, but the specifics about plausible ranges of outcomes, sample size constraints, etc, will be different in each particular setting. We’ve split up designs by Inquiry and by Data strategy. Inquires can be descriptive or causal and Data strategies can be observational or experimental. This leads to four categories of research: Observational descriptive, Experimental descriptive, Observational Causal, and Experimental causal. A third dimension along which studies can vary is whether the Answer strategy is qualitative or quantitative. If we include this dimension in our typology, we’d end up with eight broad categories of research design. We don’t see the qualitative-quantitative difference in answer strategy to be as fundamental as the differences in inquiry and data strategy, so we’ll just include both qualitative and quantitative designs in each of our four categories. Besides, social scientists always appreciate a good two-by-two: In the broadest terms, descriptive inquiries can be described as \\(f(\\mathbf{Y(Z = Realized)})\\), where \\(f()\\) is some function and \\(\\mathbf{Y(Z = Realized)}\\) is a vector of realized outcomes. That is, descriptive designs seek to summarize (using \\(f()\\)) the world as it is (as represented by \\(\\mathbf{Y(Z = Realized)}\\)). Descriptive designs can be better or worse at answering that inquiry. The quality of descriptive research designs depends on the extent of measurement, sampling, and estimation error. Causal inquiries can be described as \\(f(\\mathbf{Y(Z)})\\), where \\(Z\\) is not a realized vector of treatments, but is instead is a vector that could take on counterfactual values. A standard causal inquiry is the Average Treatment Effect, in which \\(f()\\) is the function that takes the average of the difference between two potential outcome vectors, \\(Y(Z = 1)\\) and \\(Y(Z = 0)\\). But there are many causal inquiries beyond the ATE – the thing they all have in common is that they are functions not of realized outcomes, but of potential outcomes. The quality of causal research designs depends on everything that a descriptive design depends on, but also on the understanding and quality of the mechanism that assigns units to treatment conditions. All research designs suffer from some kind of missing data problem. Rubin pointed out missing data in surveys come from people you didn’t survey or people who refused to answer. In causal inference problems, the data that are missing are the potential outcomes that were not revealed by the world. In Descriptive studies, the data that are missing are the true values of the things to be measured. Measurement error is a missing data problem too! Observational research designs are typified by researchers having no impact on the units under study. They simply record the outcomes that happened in the world and would have happened even if the study did not occur. Experimental research designs are more active – they cause some potential outcomes to be revealed but not others. In this way, researchers have an impact on the units they study. For this reason, experimental studies tend to raise more ethical questions than do observational studies. Experimenters literally change what potential outcomes become realized outcomes. Sometimes the lines between types of research become blurry. The Hawthorne effect is the name given to the idea that measuring a thing changes it. If there are Hawthorne effects, than observational research designs also change which potential outcomes are revealed. That is, if there is a difference between Y(Z = measured) and Y(Z = unmeasured), then the act of observation changes that which is observed. Passive data collection methods are sometimes preferred on these grounds. "],

Instead, researchers obtain data on a small fraction of the population and use measurements taken on that sample to draw inferences about the population. Imagine we seek to estimate the average political ideology of residents of the small town of Portola, California, on a left-right scale that varies from 1 (most liberal) to 7 (most conservative). We draw a simple random sample in which all residents have an equal chance of inclusion in the study. It’s a straightforward design but formally declaring it will make it easy to assess its properties. 14.1.4.1 Design Declaration Model: Even for this most basic of designs, researchers bring to bear a background model of the world. As described in Chapter 1, the three elements of a model are the signature, probability distributions over variables, and functional equations among variables. The signature here is a specification of the variable of interest, \\(Y\\), with a well defined domain (seven possible values between 1 and 7). In the code declaration below, we assume a uniform distribution over these 7 values. This choice is a speculation about the population distribution of \\(Y\\); some features of the design diagnosis will depend on the choice of distribution. The functional equations seem absent here as there is only one variable in the model. We could consider an elaboration of the model that includes three variables: the true outcome, \\(Y\\); the decision to measure the outcome, \\(M\\); and the measured outcome, \\(Y^M\\). We ignore this complication for now under the assumption that \\(Y = Y^M\\), i.e., that \\(Y\\) is measured perfectly. Finally, the model also includes information about the size of the population. Portola, California, has a population of approximately 2100 people as of 2010, so \\(N = 2100\\). Inquiry: Our inquiry is the population mean of \\(Y\\): \\(\\frac{1}{N} \\sum_1^N Y_i = \\bar{Y}\\). Data strategy: In simple random sampling, we draw a random sample without replacement of size \\(n\\), where every member of the population has an equal probability of inclusion in the sample, \\(\\frac{n}{N}\\). When \\(N\\) is very large relative to \\(n\\), units are drawn approximately independently. In this design we measure \\(Y\\) for \\(n=100\\) units in the sample; the other \\(N-n\\) units are not measured. Answer strategy: We estimate the population mean with the sample mean estimator: \\(\\widehat{\\overline{Y}} = \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_1^n Y_i\\). Even though our inquiry implies our answer should be a single number, an answer strategy typically also provides statistics that help us assess the uncertainty around that single number. To construct a 95% confidence interval around our estimate, we calculate the standard error of the sample mean, then approximate the sampling distribution of the sample mean estimator using a formula that includes a finite population correction. In particular, we approximate the estimated sampling distribution by a \\(t\\) distribution with \\(n - 1\\) degrees of freedom. In the code for our answer strategy, we spell out each step in turn. fixed_population &lt;- declare_population(N = 500, Y = sample(1:7, N, replace = TRUE))() random_sampling_design &lt;- declare_population(data = fixed_population) + declare_estimand(Ybar = mean(Y)) + declare_sampling(n = 100) + declare_estimator(Y ~ 1, model = lm_robust, estimand = &quot;Ybar&quot;) plot(random_sampling_design) 14.1.4.2 Takeaways With the design declared we can run a diagnosis and plot results from Monte Carlo simulations of the design: diagnosis &lt;- diagnose_design( design, sims = sims, bootstrap_sims = b_sims, diagnosands = diagnosands) The diagnosis indicates that under simple random sampling, the sample mean estimator of the population mean is unbiased. The graph on the left shows the sampling distribution of the estimator: it’s centered directly on the true value of the inquiry. Confidence intervals also have a sampling distribution – they change depending on the idiosyncrasies of each sample we happen to draw. The figure on the right shows that the 95% of the time the confidence intervals cover the true value of the estimand, as they should. As sample size grows, the sampling distribution of the estimator gets tighter, but the coverage of the confidence intervals stays at 95% – just the properties we would want out of our answer strategy. Things work well here it seems. In the exercises we suggest some small modifications of the design that point to conditions under which things might break down. 14.1.5 Stratified and clustered random sampling Researchers often cannot randomly sample at the individual level because it may, among other reasons, be too costly or logistically impractical. Instead, they may choose to randomly sample households, political precincts, or any group of individuals in order to draw inferences about the population. This strategy may be cheaper and simpler but may also introduce risks of less precise estimates. Say we are interested in the average party ideology in the entire state of California. Using cluster sampling, we randomly sample counties within the state, and within each selected county, randomly sample individuals to survey. Assuming enough variation in the outcome of interest, the random assignment of equal-sized clusters yields unbiased but imprecise estimates. By sampling clusters, we select groups of individuals who may share common attributes. Unlike simple random sampling, we need to take account of this intra-cluster correlation in our estimation of the standard error.14 The higher the degree of within-cluster similarity, the more variance we observe in cluster-level averages and the more imprecise are our estimates.15 We address this by considering cluster-robust standard errors in our answer strategy below. 14.1.5.1 Design Declaration Model: We specify the variable of interest \\(Y\\) (political ideology, say) as a discrete variable ranging from 1 (most liberal) to 7 (most conservative). We do not define a functional model since we are interested in the population mean of \\(Y\\). The model also includes information about the number of sampled clusters and the number of individuals per cluster. Inquiry: Our estimand is the population mean of political identification \\(Y\\). Because we employed random sampling, we can expect the value of the sample mean (\\(\\widehat{\\overline{y}}\\)) to approximate the true population parameter (\\(\\widehat{\\overline{Y}}\\)). Data strategy: Sampling follows a two-stage strategy. We first draw a random sample 30 counties in California, and in each county select 20 individuals at random. This guarantees that each county has the same probability of being included in the sample and each resident within a county the same probability of being in the sample. In this design we estimate \\(Y\\) for n = 600 respondents. Answer strategy: We estimate the population mean with the sample mean estimator: \\(\\widehat{\\overline{Y}} = \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_1^n Y_i\\), and estimate standard errors under the assumption of independent and heteroskedastic errors as well as cluster-robust standard errors to take into account correlation of errors within clusters. Below we demonstrate the the imprecision of our estimated \\(\\widehat{\\overline{Y}}\\) when we cluster standard errors and when we do not in the presence of an intracluster correlation coefficient (ICC) of 0.402.

The blue lines in the graph demonstrate the estimates from simulations which contain our estimand. As our table and graphs show, the share of these simulations over the total number of simulations, also known as coverage, is (correctly) close to 95% in estimations with clustered standard errors and 54% in estimations without clustered standard errors. As expected, the mean estimate itself and the bias is the same in both specifications. 14.1.5.3 Exercises Modify the declaration to change the distribution of \\(Y\\) from being uniform to something else: perhaps imagine that more extreme ideologies are more prevalent than moderate ones. Is the sample mean estimator still unbiased? Interpret your answer. Change the sampling procedure to favor units with higher values of ideology. Is the sample mean estimator still unbiased? Interpret your answer. Modify the estimation function to use this formula for the standard error: \\(\\widehat{se} \\equiv \\frac{\\widehat\\sigma}{\\sqrt{n}}\\). This equation differs from the one used in our declaration (it ignores the total population size \\(N\\)). Check that the coverage of this new design is incorrect when \\(N=n\\). Assess how large \\(N\\) has to be for the difference between these procedures not to matter. The intra-cluster correlation coefficient (ICC) can be calculated directly and is a feature of this design.↩ In ordinary least square (OLS) models, we assume errors are independent (error terms between individual observations are uncorrelated with each other) and homoskedastic (the size of errors is homogeneous across individuals). In reality, this is often not the case with cluster sampling.↩ "],

["experimental-designs-for-descriptive-inference.html", "Chapter 15 Experimental designs for descriptive inference", " Chapter 15 Experimental designs for descriptive inference Why would we ever need to do an experiment to do descriptive inference? Suppose we want to understand the causal model \\(M\\) of a violin. In particular, we have a descriptive inquiry \\(I\\) about the pitch of the highest string, the E string. We want to know if the E string is in tune. Call the latent pitch of the string \\(Y^*\\). No matter how hard we listen to the string, we can’t hear \\(Y^*\\) – it is latent. As part of a data strategy \\(D\\), we could measure the pitch by \\(P\\) plucking it: \\(Y^* -&gt; Y &lt;- P\\). This is descriptive research about the causal model \\(M\\), because the DAG of the violin includes four string nodes which each cause pitch nodes; we’d like to know a descripitive fact about the pitch nodes (what frequency they are virbaring at.) This could also be a causal inquiry: the untreated potential outcome is the pitch of the unplucked string, as defined by the frequency of vibrartion – while strings are never perfectly still, we can call the untreated potential outcome \\(Y_i(0) = 0hz\\). The treated potential outcome is the vibrations when the string is plucked \\(Y_i(1) = 650hz\\). The causal effect of plucking the string is \\(Y_i(1) - Y_i(0) = 650 - 0 = 650\\). This is a sense in which causal inference and descriptive inference are the same. Whether framed as a desriptive inquiry or a casual inquiry, we arrive at an answer of 650 hertz. Violinists reading this will know that that means the E string is flat and will need to be tuned up to \\(659.3hz\\) (if using equal temperment). "],

In our framework, this means that an inquiry \\(I\\) must have an associated answer \\(a^M\\), which refers to the answer under the model. Interestingly, we sometimes might not be conscious that the questions we ask do not have answers. Fortunately, when we ask a computer to answer such a question, it complains. How could a question not have an answer? Answerless questions can arise when inquiries depend on variables that do not exist or are undefined for some units. In other words, when there is a mismatch between the model and the inquiry, we’re asking a question about something that doesn’t exist. Consider an audit experiment (see Audit Experiment Design) that seeks to assess the effects of an email from a Latino name (versus a White name) on whether and how well election officials respond to requests for information. For example, do they use a positive or negative tone. These questions seem reasonable enough. The problem, however, is that if there are officials who don’t send responses, tone is undefined. More subtly, if there is an official that does send an email but would not have sent it in a different treatment condition, then tone is undefined for one of their potential outcomes. 15.1.4 Design Declaration Model: The model has two outcome variables, \\(R_i\\) and \\(Y_i\\). \\(R_i\\) stands for “response” and is equal to 1 if a response is sent, and 0 otherwise. \\(Y_i\\) is the tone of the response and is normally distributed when it is defined. \\(Z_i\\) is the treatment and equals 1 if the email is sent using a Latino name and 0 otherwise. The table below shows the potential outcomes for four possible types of subjects, depending on the potential outcomes of \\(R_i\\). A types always respond regardless of treatment and D types never respond, regardless of treatment. B types respond if and only if they are treated, whereas C types respond if and only if they are not treated. The table also includes columns for the potential outcomes of \\(Y_i\\), showing which potential outcome subjects would express depending on their type. The key thing to note is that for the B, C, and D types, the effect of treatment on \\(Y_i\\) is undefined because messages never sent have no tone. The last (and very important) feature of our model is that the outcomes \\(Y_i\\) are possibly correlated with subject type. Even though both \\(E[Y_i(1) | \\text{Type} = A]\\) and \\(E[Y_i(1) | \\text{Type} = B]\\) exist, there’s no reason to expect that they are the same. In the design we assume a distribution of types with 40% A, 5% B, 10% C, and 45% D. Causal Types Type \\(R_i(0)\\) \\(R_i(1)\\) \\(Y_i(0)\\) \\(Y_i(1)\\) A 1 1 \\(Y_i(0)\\) \\(Y_i(1)\\) B 0 1 NA \\(Y_i(1)\\) C 1 0 \\(Y_i(0)\\) NA D 0 0 NA NA Inquiry: We have two inquiries. The first is straightforward: \\(E[R_i(1) - R_i(0)]\\) is the Average Treatment Effect on response. The second inquiry is the undefined inquiry that does not have an answer: \\(E[Y_i(1) - Y_i(0)]\\). We will also consider a third inquiry, which is defined: \\(E[Y_i(1) - Y_i(0) | \\mathrm{Type} = A]\\), which is the average effect of treatment on tone among \\(A\\) types. Data strategy: The data strategy will be to use complete random assignment to assign 250 of 500 units to treatment.

First, as expected, our experiment is unbiased for the average treatment effect on response. Next, we see that our second inquiry, as well as our diagnostics for it, are undefined. The diagnosis tells us that our definition of potential outcomes produces a definition problem for the estimand. Note that the diagnosands that are defined, including power, depend only on the answer strategy and not on the estimand. Finally, our third estimand – the average effects for the \\(A\\) types – is defined but our estimates are biased. The reason for this is that we cannot tell from the data which types are the \\(A\\) types: we are not conditioning on the correct subset. Indeed, we are unable to condition on the correct subset. If a subject responds in the treatment group, we don’t know if she is an \\(A\\) or a \\(B\\) type; in the control group, we can’t tell if a responder is an \\(A\\) or a \\(C\\) type. Our difference-in-means estimator of the ATE on \\(Y\\) among \\(A\\)s will be off whenever \\(A\\)s have different outcomes from \\(B\\)s and \\(C\\)s. In some cases, the problem might be resolved by changing the inquiry. Closely related estimands can often be defined, perhaps by redefining \\(Y\\) (e.g., emails never sent have a tone of zero). Some redefinitions of the problem, as in the one we examine above, require estimating effects for unobserved subgroups which is a difficult challenge. 15.1.6 Applications This kind of problem is surprisingly common. Here are three more distinct instances of the problem: \\(Y\\) is the decision to vote Democrat (\\(Y=1\\)) or Republican (\\(Y=0\\)), \\(R\\) is the decision to turn out to vote and \\(Z\\) is a campaign message. The decision to vote may depend on treatment but if subjects do not vote then \\(Y\\) is undefined. \\(Y\\) is the weight of infants, \\(R\\) is whether a child is born and \\(Z\\) is a maternal health intervention. Fertility may depend on treatment but the weight of unborn (possibly never conceived) babies is not defined. \\(Y\\) is the charity to whom contributions are made during fundraising and \\(R\\) is whether anything is contributed and \\(Z\\) is an encouragement to contribute. The identity of beneficiaries is not defined if there are no contributions. All of these problem exhibit a form of post treatment bias (see section Post treatment bias) but the issue goes beyond picking the right estimator. Our problem here is conceptual: the effect of treatment on the outcome just doesn’t exist for some subjects. 15.1.7 Exercises The amount of bias on the third estimand depends on both the distribution of types and the correlation of types with the potential outcomes of Y. Modify the declaration so that the estimator of the effect on Y is unbiased, changing only the distribution of types. Repeat the exercise, changing only the correlation of type with the potential outcomes of \\(Y\\). Try approaching the problem by redefining the inquiry, seeking to assess the effect of treatment on the share of responses with positive tone. "],

Responses may be affected by sensitivity bias, or the tendency of survey subjects to dissemble for fear of negative repercussions if some reference group learns their true response (Blair, Coppock, and Moor 2018). In such cases, standard survey estimates based on direct questions will be biased. One class of solutions to this problem is to obscure individual responses, providing protection from social or legal pressures. When we obscure responses systematically through an experiment, we can often still identify average quantities of interest. One such design is the list experiment (introduced by Miller (1984)), which asks respondents for the count of the number of `yes’ responses to a series of questions including the sensitive item, rather than for a yes or no answer on the sensitive item itself. List experiments give subjects cover by aggregating their answer to the sensitive item with responses to other questions. During the 2016 Presidential Election in the U.S., some observers were concerned that pre-election estimates of support for Donald Trump might have been downward biased by “Shy Trump Supporters” – survey respondents who supported Trump in their hearts, but were embarrassed to admit it to pollsters. To assess this possibility, Coppock (2017) obtained estimates of Trump support that were free of social desirability bias using a list experiment. Subjects in the control and treatment groups were asked: “Here is a list of [three/four] things that some people would do and some people would not. Please tell me HOW MANY of them you would do. We do not want to know which ones of these you would do, just how many. Here are the [three/four] things:” Control Treatment If it were up for a vote, I would vote to raise the minimum wage to 15 dollars an hour If it were up for a vote, I would vote to raise the minimum wage to 15 dollars an hour If it were up for a vote, I would vote to repeal the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare If it were up for a vote, I would vote to repeal the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare If it were up for a vote, I would vote to ban assault weapons If it were up for a vote, I would vote to ban assault weapons If the 2016 presidential election were being held today and the candidates were Hillary Clinton (Democrat) and Donald Trump (Republican), I would vote for Donald Trump. The treatment group averaged 1.843 items while the control group averaged 1.548 items, for a difference-in-means estimate 0.296. We will show this is an unbiased estimator for the average treatment effect between being asked to respond to the treated list and the control list (invoking the usual assumptions of randomized experiments, including SUTVA). But our estimand is the proportion of people who support Donald Trump. For the difference-in-means to be an unbiased estimator of the proportion of respondents who would say “yes” to the sensitive item, we invoke two additional assumptions: no design effects and no “liars” (see Imai 2011). The first highlights the fact that we need a good estimate of the average control item count from the control group (in this example 1.843). We use that to net out the control item count from responses to the treated group (what is left is the sensitive item proportion). When respondents provide a different control item count in the treated group than in the control group, for example because they evaluate items relatively and the inclusion of the sensitive item changes their answers (see Flavin and Keane 2011), the design breaks down. The no liars assumption says that respondents provide truthful answers to the sensitive item within the count. The justification for the assumption is that the plausible cover of being asked within a count makes it possible for respondents to answer truthfully. The estimate is, under these assumptions, free from sensitivity bias, but it’s also much higher variance. The 95% confidence interval for the list experiment estimate is nearly 14 percentage points wide, whereas the the 95% confidence interval for the (possibly biased!) direct question asked of the same sample is closer to 4 percentage points. The choice between list experiments and direct question is therefore a bias-variance tradeoff. List experiments may have less bias, but they are higher variance. Direct questions may be biased, but they have less variance. 15.2.4.1 Declaration Model: Our model includes subjects’ true support for Donald Trump and whether or not they are “shy”. These two variables combine to determine how subjects will respond when asked directly about Trump support. The potential outcomes model combines three types of information to determine how subjects will respond to the list experiment: their responses to the three nonsensitive control items, their true support for Trump, and whether they are assigned to see the treatment or the control list. Notice that our definition of the potential outcomes embeds the no liars and no design effects assumptions required for the list experiment design. We also have a global parameter that reflects our expectations about the proportion of Trump supporters who are shy. It’s set at 6%, which is large enough to make a difference for polling, but not so large as to be implausible. Inquiry: Our estimand is the proportion of voters who actually plan to vote for Trump. Data strategy: First we sample 500 respondents from the U.S. population at random, then we randomly assign 250 of the 500 to treatment and the remainder to control. In the survey, we ask subjects both the direct question and the list experiment question. Answer strategy: We estimate the proportion of truthful Trump voters in two ways. First, we take the mean of answers to the direct question. Second, we take the difference in means in the responses to the list experiment question. # Model ------------------------------------------------------------------- proportion_shy &lt;- .06 list_design &lt;- # Model declare_population( N = 5000, # true trump vote (unobservable) truthful_trump_vote = draw_binary(.45, N), # shy voter (unobservable) shy = draw_binary(proportion_shy, N), # direct question response (1 if Trump supporter and not shy, 0 otherwise) Y_direct = if_else(truthful_trump_vote == 1 &amp; shy == 0, 1, 0), # nonsensitive list experiment items raise_minimum_wage = draw_binary(.8, N), repeal_obamacare = draw_binary(.6, N), ban_assault_weapons = draw_binary(.5, N) ) + declare_potential_outcomes( Y_list_Z_0 = raise_minimum_wage + repeal_obamacare + ban_assault_weapons, Y_list_Z_1 = Y_list_Z_0 + truthful_trump_vote ) + # Inquiry declare_estimand(proportion_truthful_trump_vote = mean(truthful_trump_vote), ATE = mean(Y_list_Z_1 - Y_list_Z_0)) + # Data Strategy declare_sampling(n = 500) + declare_assignment(prob = .5) + declare_reveal(Y_list) + # Answer Strategy declare_estimator( Y_direct ~ 1, model = lm_robust, term = &quot;(Intercept)&quot;, estimand = &quot;proportion_truthful_trump_vote&quot;, label = &quot;direct&quot;) + declare_estimator( Y_list ~ Z, model = difference_in_means, estimand = c(&quot;proportion_truthful_trump_vote&quot;, &quot;ATE&quot;), label = &quot;list&quot;) simulations_list &lt;- simulate_design(list_design, sims = sims) The plot shows the sampling distribution of the direct and list experiment estimators. The sampling distribution of the direct question is tight but biased; the list experiment (if the requisite assumptions hold) is unbiased, but higher variance. The choice between these two estimators of the prevalence rate depends on which – bias or variance – is more important in a particular setting. See Blair, Coppock, and Moor (2018) for an extended discussion of how the choice of research design depends deeply on the purpose of the project. 15.2.4.2 Violations of identifying assumptions In our model, the definition of the treated potential outcome, Y_list_Z_1 = Y_list_Z_0 + truthful_trump_vote, bakes in the no design effects and no liars assumptions. The first component is the control item count Y_list_Z_0, which ensures the respondent’s count of control items is the same in both groups. The second is the true trump vote, which assumes no liars. What do we learn from this experimental design if these assumptions do not hold? We examine the case of “ceiling effects,” in which respondents whose control item count is the maximum (in the example, they would vote yes to all three control items) withhold their true support for Trump in the treatment group. We thus redefine the treated potential outcome to be a function of the original count, but those who would respond 4 (all control items plus Trump support) instead respond 3. These are the “liars.” list_design_ceiling &lt;- replace_step( list_design, step = 2, new_step = declare_potential_outcomes( Y_list_Z_0 = raise_minimum_wage + repeal_obamacare + ban_assault_weapons, Y_list_Z_1_no_liars = Y_list_Z_0 + truthful_trump_vote, Y_list_Z_1 = ifelse(Y_list_Z_1_no_liars == 4, 3, Y_list_Z_1_no_liars)) ) diagnosis_list_ceiling &lt;- diagnose_design(list_design_ceiling, sims = sims, bootstrap_sims = b_sims) estimator_label estimand_label bias rmse list ATE -0.022 0.091 direct proportion_truthful_trump_vote -0.026 0.031 list proportion_truthful_trump_vote -0.127 0.153 We see that the list experiment is still an unbiased estimator for the average difference in responses to the treatment list and the shorter control list (ATE). But under ceiling effects, it is no longer an unbiased estimator for the proportion of truthful Trump vote. Indeed, it is more unbiased than the direct question. The divergence illustrates a common feature of experimental designs for descriptive inference: the average treatment effect can be estimated without bias under SUTVA and randomization with these designs, but additional assumptions are required in order to add an interpretation of the ATE as the descriptive quantity of interest. The burden is on the researcher to demonstrate the credibility of these additional assumptions. The experimental design alone is not sufficient justification. 15.2.4.3 Addressing potential assumption violations by design Researchers may bolster the assumptions to identify the descriptive estimand through changes to the data strategy or the answer strategy. Changes to the data strategy for the list experiment aim to reduce the risk of design effects and violations of the no liars assumptions. For example, when there is a risk of ceiling effects, Glynn (2013) proposes selecting control items that are inversely correlated. With three items, if two of the items are perfectly negatively correlated (i.e., if you say “yes” to one item you say “no” to the other), then the control item count will always be below the maximum of three when ceiling effects bite. We illustrate this design change by replacing the population declaration for the design with ceiling effects. This change is in the population, but is really a part of the data strategy because it involves the choice of measurement tool (which control items the researcher selects to ask respondents). We see that the design is stil lunbiased for the ATE and now is unbiased for the proportion of truthful Trump vote. This is because there are no longer ceiling effects, which represented a violation of the no design effects assumption required to interpret the ATE as the proportion of truthful Trump vote. Changes the answer strategy have been proposed to address both the no design effects and no liars assumption. Blair and Imai (2012) propose a statistical test for the design effects assumption; if it does not pass, they suggest not analyzing the list experiment data (i.e., this is a procedure that makes up an answer strategy). Scholars have also identified improvements to the answer strategy to address violations of no liars: Blair and Imai (2012) provides a model that adjusts for ceiling and floor effects and Li (2019) provides a bounds approach that relaxes the assumption. 15.2.5 Randomized response technique library(rr) rr_forced_known &lt;- function(data) { fit &lt;- try(rrreg(Y_forced_known ~ 1, data = data, p = 2/3, p0 = 1/6, p1 = 1/6, design = &quot;forced-known&quot;)) pred &lt;- try(as.data.frame(predict(fit, avg = TRUE, quasi.bayes = TRUE))) if(class(fit) != &quot;try-error&quot; &amp; class(pred) != &quot;try-error&quot;) { names(pred) &lt;- c(&quot;estimate&quot;, &quot;std.error&quot;, &quot;conf.low&quot;, &quot;conf.high&quot;) pred$p.value &lt;- with(pred, 2 * pnorm(-abs(estimate / std.error))) } else { pred &lt;- data.frame(estimate = NA, std.error = NA, conf.low = NA, conf.high = NA, p.value = NA, error = TRUE) } pred } rr_mirrored &lt;- function(data) { fit &lt;- try(rrreg(Y_mirrored ~ 1, data = data, p = 2/3, design = &quot;mirrored&quot;)) pred &lt;- try(as.data.frame(predict(fit, avg = TRUE, quasi.bayes = TRUE))) if(class(fit) != &quot;try-error&quot; &amp; class(pred) != &quot;try-error&quot;) { names(pred) &lt;- c(&quot;estimate&quot;, &quot;std.error&quot;, &quot;conf.low&quot;, &quot;conf.high&quot;) pred$p.value &lt;- with(pred, 2 * pnorm(-abs(estimate / std.error))) } else { pred &lt;- data.frame(estimate = NA, std.error = NA, conf.low = NA, conf.high = NA, p.value = NA, error = TRUE) } pred } proportion_shy &lt;- .06 rr_design &lt;- declare_population( N = 100, # true trump vote (unobservable) truthful_trump_vote = draw_binary(.45, N), # shy voter (unobservable) shy = draw_binary(proportion_shy, N), # Direct question response (1 if Trump supporter and not shy, 0 otherwise) Y_direct = as.numeric(truthful_trump_vote == 1 &amp; shy == 0)) + declare_estimand(sensitive_item_proportion = mean(truthful_trump_vote)) + declare_potential_outcomes(Y_forced_known ~ (dice == 1) * 0 + (dice %in% 2:5) * truthful_trump_vote + (dice == 6) * 1, conditions = 1:6, assignment_variable = &quot;dice&quot;) + declare_potential_outcomes(Y_mirrored ~ (coin == &quot;heads&quot;) * truthful_trump_vote + (coin == &quot;tails&quot;) * (1 - truthful_trump_vote), conditions = c(&quot;heads&quot;, &quot;tails&quot;), assignment_variable = &quot;coin&quot;) + declare_assignment(prob_each = rep(1/6, 6), conditions = 1:6, assignment_variable = &quot;dice&quot;) + declare_assignment(prob_each = c(2/3, 1/3), conditions = c(&quot;heads&quot;, &quot;tails&quot;), assignment_variable = &quot;coin&quot;) + declare_reveal(Y_forced_known, dice) + declare_reveal(Y_mirrored, coin) + declare_estimator(handler = tidy_estimator(rr_forced_known), label = &quot;forced_known&quot;, estimand = &quot;sensitive_item_proportion&quot;) + declare_estimator(handler = tidy_estimator(rr_mirrored), label = &quot;mirrored&quot;, estimand = &quot;sensitive_item_proportion&quot;) + declare_estimator(Y_direct ~ 1, model = lm_robust, term = &quot;(Intercept)&quot;, label = &quot;direct&quot;, estimand = &quot;sensitive_item_proportion&quot;) rr_design &lt;- set_diagnosands(rr_design, diagnosands = declare_diagnosands(select = c(mean_estimate, bias, rmse, power))) rr_diagnosis &lt;- diagnose_design(rr_design, sims = sims, bootstrap_sims = b_sims) kable(reshape_diagnosis(rr_diagnosis)) Design Label Estimand Label Estimator Label Term N Sims Mean Estimate Bias RMSE Power rr_design sensitive_item_proportion direct (Intercept) 10 0.43 -0.02 0.03 1.00 (0.01) (0.00) (0.00) (0.00) rr_design sensitive_item_proportion forced_known NA 10 0.45 -0.00 0.02 1.00 (0.02) (0.01) (0.00) (0.00) rr_design sensitive_item_proportion mirrored NA 10 0.42 -0.03 0.09 0.90 (0.04) (0.03) (0.02) (0.10) 15.2.5.1 Bias-variance tradeoff rr_designs &lt;- redesign(rr_design, proportion_shy = seq(from = 0, to = 0.5, by = 0.05), N = seq(from = 500, to = 5000, by = 500)) rr_tradeoff_diagnosis &lt;- diagnose_design(rr_designs, sims = sims, bootstrap_sims = b_sims) 15.2.6 References References "],

Even though researchers do not control the assignment, substantive knowledge about the threshold serves as a basis for a strong identification claim. Thistlewhite and Campbell introduced the regression discontinuity design in the 1960s to study the impact of scholarships on academic success. Their insight was that students with a test score just above a scholarship cutoff were plausibly comparable to students whose scores were just below the cutoff, so any differences in future academic success could be attributed to the scholarship itself. Regression discontinuity designs identify a local average treatment effect: the average effect of treatment exactly at the cutoff. The main trouble with the design is that there is vanishingly little data exactly at the cutoff, so any answer strategy needs to use data that is some distance away from the cutoff. The further away from the cutoff we move, the larger the threat of bias. We’ll consider an application of the regression discontinuity design that examines party incumbency advantage – the effect of a party winning an election on its vote margin in the next election. 16.4.4 Design Declaration Model: Regression discontinuity designs have four components: A running variable, a cutoff, a treatment variable, and an outcome. The cutoff determines which units are treated depending on the value of the running variable. In our example, the running variable \\(X\\) is the Democratic party’s margin of victory at time \\(t-1\\); and the treatment, \\(Z\\), is whether the Democratic party won the election in time \\(t-1\\). The outcome, \\(Y\\), is the Democratic vote margin at time \\(t\\). We’ll consider a population of 1,000 of these pairs of elections. A major assumption required for regression discontinuity is that the conditional expectation functions for both treatment and control potential outcomes are continuous at the cutoff.16 To satisfy this assumption, we specify two smooth conditional expectation functions, one for each potential outcome. The figure plots \\(Y\\) (the Democratic vote margin at time \\(t\\)) against \\(X\\) (the margin at time \\(t-1\\)). We’ve also plotted the true conditional expectation functions for the treated and control potential outcomes. The solid lines correspond to the observed data and the dashed lines correspond to the unobserved data. cutoff &lt;- .5 control &lt;- function(X) { as.vector(poly(X, 4, raw = TRUE) %*% c(.7, -.8, .5, 1))} treatment &lt;- function(X) { as.vector(poly(X, 4, raw = TRUE) %*% c(0, -1.5, .5, .8)) + .15} rd_design &lt;- # Model ------------------------------------------------------------------- declare_population( N = 1000, X = runif(N, 0, 1) - cutoff, noise = rnorm(N, 0, .1), Z = 1 * (X &gt; 0) ) + declare_potential_outcomes(Y ~ Z * treatment(X) + (1 - Z) * control(X) + noise) + # Inquiry ----------------------------------------------------------------- declare_estimand(LATE = treatment(0) - control(0)) + # Data Strategy ----------------------------------------------------------------- declare_reveal(Y, Z) + # Answer Strategy --------------------------------------------------------- declare_estimator(formula = Y ~ poly(X, 4) * Z, model = lm_robust, estimand = &quot;LATE&quot;) Inquiry: Our estimand is the effect of a Democratic win in an election on the Democratic vote margin of the next election, when the Democratic vote margin of the first election is zero. Formally, it is the difference in the conditional expectation functions of the control and treatment potential outcomes when the running variable is exactly zero. The black vertical line in the plot shows this difference. Data strategy: We collect data on the Democratic vote share at time \\(t-1\\) and time \\(t\\) for all 1,000 pairs of elections. There is no sampling or random assignment. Answer strategy: We will approximate the treated and untreated conditional expectation functions to the left and right of the cutoff using a flexible regression specification estimated via OLS. In particular, we fit each regression using a fourth-order polynomial. Much of the literature on regression discontinuity designs focuses on the tradeoffs among answer strategies, with many analysts recommending against higher-order polynomial regression specifications. We use one here to highlight how well such an answer strategy does when it matches the functional form in the model. We discuss alternative estimators in the exercises. rd_diagnosis &lt;- diagnose_design(rd_design, sims = sims, bootstrap_sims = b_sims) Now all that simulating, saving, and loading is done, and we can use the simulations for whatever you want. summary(rd_diagnosis) ## ## Research design diagnosis based on 100 simulations.

First, the power of this design is very low: with 1,000 units we do not achieve even 10% statistical power. However, our estimates of the uncertainty are not too wide: the coverage probability indicates that our confidence intervals indeed contain the estimand 95% of the time as they should. Our answer strategy is highly uncertain because the fourth-order polynomial specification in regression model gives weights to the data that greatly increase the variance of the estimator (Gelman and Imbens (2017)). In the exercises we explore alternative answer strategies that perform better. Second, the design is biased because polynomial approximations of the average effect at exactly the point of the threshold will be inaccurate in small samples (Sekhon and Titiunik (2017)), especially as units farther away from the cutoff are incorporated into the answer strategy. We know that the estimated bias is not due to simulation error by examining the bootstrapped standard error of the bias estimates. Finally, from the figure, we can see how poorly the average effect at the threshold approximates the average effect for all units. The average treatment effect among the treated (to the right of the threshold in the figure) is negative, whereas at the threshold it is positive. This clarifies that the estimand of the regression discontinuity design, the difference at the cutoff, is only relevant for a small – and possibly empty – set of units very close to the cutoff. 16.4.6 Further Reading Since its rediscovery by social scientists in the late 1990s, the regression discontinuity design has been widely used to study diverse causal effects such as: prison on recidivism (Mitchell et al. (2017)); China’s one child policy on human capital (Qin, Zhuang, and Yang (2017)); eligibility for World Bank loans on political liberalization (Carnegie and Samii (2017)); and anti-discrimination laws on minority employment (Hahn, Todd, and Van der Klaauw (1999)). We’ve discussed a “sharp” regression discontinuity design in which all units above the threshold were treated and all units below were untreated. In fuzzy regression discontinuity designs, some units above the cutoff remain untreated or some units below take treatment. This setting is analogous to experiments that experience noncompliance and may require instrumental variables approaches to the answer strategy (see Compliance is a Potential Outcome). Geographic regression discontinuity designs use distance to a border as the running variable: units on one side of the border are treated and units on the other are untreated. Keele and Titiunik (2016) use such a design to study whether voters are more likely to turn out when they have the opportunity to vote directly on legislation on so-called ballot initiatives. A complication of this design is how to measure distance to the border in two dimensions. 16.4.7 Exercises Gelman and Imbens (2017) point out that higher order polynomial regression specifications lead to extreme regression weights. One approach to obtaining better estimates is to select a bandwidth, \\(h\\), around the cutoff, and run a linear regression. Declare a sampling procedure that subsets the data to a bandwidth around the threshold, as well as a first order linear regression specification, and analyze how the power, bias, RMSE, and coverage of the design vary as a function of the bandwidth. The rdrobust estimator in the rdrobust package implements a local polynomial estimator that automatically selects a bandwidth for the RD analysis and bias-corrected confidence intervals. Declare another estimator using the rdrobust function and add it to the design. How does the coverage and bias of this estimator compare to the regression approaches declared above? Reduce the number of polynomial terms of the the treatment() and control() functions and assess how the bias of the design changes as the potential outcomes become increasingly linear as a function of the running variable. Redefine the population function so that units with higher potential outcome are more likely to locate just above the cutoff than below it. Assess whether and how this affects the bias of the design.

Sarah Bohn, Magnus Lofstrom, and Steven Raphael The Review of Economics and Statistics 2014 96:2, 258-269 Abstract: We test for an effect of Arizona’s 2007 Legal Arizona Workers Act (LAWA) on the proportion of the state’s population characterized as noncitizen Hispanic. We use the synthetic control method to select a group of states against which Arizona’s population trends can be compared. We document a notable and statistically significant reduction in the proportion of the Hispanic noncitizen population in Arizona.

Outline: (1) how does synth work? - declaration: set up states with time trends and levels that are both correlated with a type and following the linear model assumed by SCM - try three estimators: (1) difference-in-difference; (2) single difference in treated period; and (3) difference in treated period weighted by Synth weights. - show that synth works under its assumptions; plot of time series of treat and synthetic control; plot of the time series from all units to illustrate which are picked (sorted by weights) (2) what are synth’s assumptions? - linear model; treated unit is in convex hull of control units’ pretreatment time series (3) how to diagnose when you are outside the convex hull - declaration outside the convex hull and use the Abadie diagnostic demonstrating a poor match. (possibly explore power of this diagnostic) - show that synth is biased in this setting. augsynth is not. # tidy function that takes data and just adds the synthetic control weights to it synth_weights_tidy &lt;- function(data) { dataprep.out &lt;- dataprep( foo = data, predictors = &quot;prop_non_hispanic_below_hs&quot;, predictors.op = &quot;mean&quot;, time.predictors.prior = 1998:2006, dependent = &quot;prop_non_hispanic_below_hs&quot;, unit.variable = &quot;state_number&quot;, time.variable = &quot;year&quot;, treatment.identifier = 4, controls.identifier = c(1:3, 5:50), # states without Arizona time.optimize.ssr = 1998:2006, time.plot = 1998:2009) capture.output(fit &lt;- synth(data.prep.obj = dataprep.out)) tab &lt;- synth.tab(dataprep.res = dataprep.out, synth.res = fit) data %&gt;% left_join(tab$tab.w %&gt;% mutate(synth_weights = w.weights) %&gt;% dplyr::select(synth_weights, unit.numbers), by = c(&quot;state_number&quot; = &quot;unit.numbers&quot;)) %&gt;% mutate(synth_weights = replace(synth_weights, state_number == 4, 1)) } augsynth_tidy &lt;- function(data) { fit &lt;- augsynth(prop_non_hispanic_below_hs ~ legal_worker_act, state, year, t_int = 2007, data = data) res &lt;- summary(fit)$att %&gt;% filter(Time == 2007) %&gt;% select(Estimate, Std.Error) names(res) &lt;- c(&quot;estimate&quot;, &quot;std.error&quot;) res$p.value &lt;- 2 * pt(-abs(res$estimate/res$std.error), df = nrow(data) - 15) res$conf.low &lt;- res$estimate - 1.96 * res$std.error res$conf.high &lt;- res$estimate + 1.96 * res$std.error res } # note need to clean up the range of the data, currently over 1 design &lt;- declare_population( states = add_level( N = 50, state = state.abb, state_number = as.numeric(as.factor(state)), state_shock = runif(N, -.15, .15), border_state = state %in% c(&quot;AZ&quot;, &quot;CA&quot;, &quot;NM&quot;, &quot;TX&quot;), state_shock = ifelse(border_state, .2, state_shock) ), years = add_level( N = 12, nest = FALSE, year = 1998:2009, post_treatment_period = year &gt;= 2007, year_shock = runif(N, -.025, .025), year_trend = year - 1998 ), obs = cross_levels( by = join(states, years), # treatment indicator: legal_worker_act = if_else(post_treatment_period == TRUE &amp; state == &quot;AZ&quot;, 1, 0), state_year_shock = runif(N, -.025, .025), prop_non_hispanic_below_hs_baseline = 0.4 + state_shock + year_shock + (.01 + .05 * border_state) * year_trend + state_year_shock ) ) + declare_potential_outcomes( prop_non_hispanic_below_hs ~ prop_non_hispanic_below_hs_baseline + 0.25 * legal_worker_act, assignment_variable = legal_worker_act) + declare_estimand( ATE_AZ = mean(prop_non_hispanic_below_hs_legal_worker_act_1 - prop_non_hispanic_below_hs_legal_worker_act_0), subset = legal_worker_act == TRUE) + declare_reveal(prop_non_hispanic_below_hs, legal_worker_act) + declare_step(handler = synth_weights_tidy) + declare_estimator( prop_non_hispanic_below_hs ~ legal_worker_act, subset = year &gt;= 2007, weights = synth_weights, model = lm_robust, label = &quot;synth&quot;) + declare_estimator( prop_non_hispanic_below_hs ~ legal_worker_act, subset = year &gt;= 2007, model = lm_robust, label = &quot;unweighted&quot;) + declare_estimator( prop_non_hispanic_below_hs ~ I(state == &quot;AZ&quot;) + post_treatment_period + legal_worker_act, term = &quot;legal_worker_act&quot;, model = lm_robust, label = &quot;unweighted_did&quot;) + declare_estimator(handler = tidy_estimator(augsynth_tidy), label = &quot;augsynth&quot;) state_data &lt;- draw_data(design) state_data %&gt;% dplyr::select(state, synth_weights) %&gt;% distinct %&gt;% arrange(-synth_weights) %&gt;% head ## state synth_weights ## 1 AZ 1.000 ## 2 NM 0.990 ## 3 TX 0.007 ## 4 CA 0.001 ## 5 AL 0.000 ## 6 AK 0.000 state_data %&gt;% ggplot() + geom_line(aes(year, prop_non_hispanic_below_hs)) + facet_wrap(~ state) state_data %&gt;% mutate(treatment_state = factor(state == &quot;AZ&quot;, levels = c(FALSE, TRUE), labels = c(&quot;Synthethic Control&quot;, &quot;Arizona&quot;))) %&gt;% group_by(treatment_state, year) %&gt;% summarize(prop_non_hispanic_below_hs = weighted.mean(prop_non_hispanic_below_hs, w = synth_weights)) %&gt;% ggplot(aes(x = year, y = prop_non_hispanic_below_hs, color = treatment_state)) + geom_line() + geom_vline(xintercept = 2007) + scale_x_continuous(breaks = scales::pretty_breaks()) + annotate(&quot;text&quot;, x = 2006.7, y = 1.7, label = &quot;Law Introduced in 2007&quot;, hjust = &quot;right&quot;, family = &quot;Palatino&quot;) + labs(color = &quot;&quot;) + xlab(&quot;&quot;) + ylab(&quot;Proportion Non-Hispanic Below H.S.

The first panel of Figure X illustrates where the study gets its name: here, two randomly selected individuals (or clusters) enter the treatment at before each of the three waves of measurement, while two individuals are randomly selected to remain in control. Such designs have a remarkable feature: because who enters the treatment group at any given stage is random, the data collected in each measurement wave can (almost) be treated like a fresh experiment. Often, stepped wedge designs are vaunted for their policy appeal: stepped wedges are a good option for rigorous causal inference when it’s not fair or feasible to prevent some people from getting a treatment. Yet, that same goal can be achieved in the context of any experiment with one wave of measurement: just treat the control once you’ve conducted the final measurement. The real advantage of the stepped wedge is not its ethical appeal: it’s the ability to squeeze more power out of a small sample. Stepped-wedge designs are more complicated than they at first appear. Below, we explain why: this design can be thought of as a block-randomized experiment with heterogeneous probabilities and a high risk of spillovers. Show SW is better-powered but both coefficient and SE will be biased if not analyzed correctly. Show how allocating more sample in earlier waves better here due to high variance in treatment POs. Show how spillovers are very plausible and can be overcome. Show extreme case in which no power gain from SW (when u_it = 0, ICC = 1): this is the intuition behind SW – power gains derive from inter-temporal variation 17.6.4 Design Declaration Model: our design has eight units randomized and remeasured at three time points. Units’ untreated potential outcomes consist of an unit- and a unit-period-specific shock. Their treated potential increases relative to their control potential outcome by a rate of 1 each period (see second panel of Figure X). Inquiry: Since any unit at any given point in time reveals one of only two potential outcomes, we can define our estimand simply as the average treatment effect. As panel 2 shows, the ATE averaged over the three periods is (1 + 2 + 3) / 3 = 2. An important assumption that enables us to define the estimand in this way is that units reveal the same treated or untreated potential outcome, irrespective of what happened in the previous period. This amounts to a no spillovers assumption, which may be implausible in practice. We return to this below. Data strategy: our assignment strategy works in two stages. We first cluster-assign unit-periods to a wave in which they will be treated. One-quarter of the units are not treated in any wave (pure control): p_00 = 2/8. The remaining three quarters are distributed evenly among the three waves of treatment: p_W1 &lt;- p_W2 &lt;- p_W3 &lt;- 2/8. In a second phase, the wave assignment is converted into a simple indicator, Z, for whether the unit is treated in a given period or not. There is an important but subtle difference between the wave and Z variables [explain Z is joint prob] Answer strategy: [describe: we look at an approach that treats it like blocks. What are inverse propensities weights? Simply put, they correspond to the number of observations that a sampled observation “represents.” We also compare to the power of a design that only involves one wave of measurement, e.g. at wave 2 where units are treated 5050.] p_00 &lt;- p_W1 &lt;- p_W2 &lt;- p_W3 &lt;- 2/8 design &lt;- declare_population( t = add_level(N = 3, trend = as.numeric(t), # u_t = rnorm(N), p = c(p_W1, p_W1 + p_W2, p_W1 + p_W2 + p_W3)), i = add_level(N = 8, u_i = rnorm(N), nest = FALSE), obs = cross_levels(by = join(t, i), u_it = rnorm(N))) + declare_potential_outcomes(Y_Z_0 = u_i + u_it, Y_Z_1 = u_i + u_it + trend) + declare_assignment(clusters = i, conditions = 1:4, prob_each = c(p_W1, p_W2, p_W3, p_00), assignment_variable = &quot;wave&quot;) + declare_step(Z = as.numeric(t &gt;= wave), ip = 1 / (Z * p + (1 - Z) * (1 - p)), handler = fabricate) + declare_reveal(Y, Z) + declare_estimand(ate = mean(Y_Z_1 - Y_Z_0)) + declare_estimator(Y ~ Z, model = lm_robust, label = &quot;1: Wave 2 only&quot;, subset = t == 2) + declare_estimator(Y ~ Z, model = lm_robust, label = &quot;2: Weighted, clustered SW&quot;, weights = ip, clusters = i) + declare_estimator(Y ~ Z, model = lm_robust, label = &quot;3: Unweighted, unclustered SW&quot;) # Diagnose design diagnosis &lt;- diagnose_design(design) Estimator Label Bias Power Coverage Mean Estimate SD Estimate Mean Se 1: Wave 2 only 0.06 0.38 0.92 2.06 1.04 0.95 (0.04) (0.02) (0.01) (0.04) (0.03) (0.01) 2: Weighted, clustered SW 0.04 0.53 0.96 2.04 0.79 0.77 (0.03) (0.02) (0.01) (0.03) (0.03) (0.01) 3: Unweighted, unclustered SW 0.36 0.94 0.86 2.36 0.68 0.59 (0.03) (0.01) (0.02) (0.03) (0.02) (0.00) Comparing 1 and 2, stepped wedge gives a big improvement in power, is unbiased, and gets the coverage correct. Clearly better than just doing a cross-section at wave 2. Estimator 3 shows two pitfalls, however, that can lead us to overestimate benefits of SW. First, it is biased: [explain how treated POs are more commonly observed in periods when they’re higher, we need to weight for this. How weights come about: There is one way that a unit can be observed in a treated state in wave 1: they are assigned to W1 with probability p_W1. There are two ways in which a unit can be treated in wave 2: they are assigned in W1 with p_W1 or in W2 with p_W2. Because being assigned in W1 or in W2 are exclusive and independent events, we can get the prob of being treated in any period by wave 2 by summing the probs.] Second, standard errors are wrong. Units should be treated as clusters (draw analogue to two-stage random assignment in saturation design?) A natural question is how power changes as more or fewer units are assigned. Here, we consider variations on the stepped wedge design declared above, in which we hold constant at 3 the number of units assigned to the pure control, and shift an increasing proportion of the assignment to later waves. designs &lt;- list( a = redesign(design, p_00 = 3/8, p_W1 = 3/8, p_W2 = 1/8, p_W3 = 1/8), b = redesign(design, p_00 = 3/8, p_W1 = 2/8, p_W2 = 2/8, p_W3 = 1/8), c = redesign(design, p_00 = 3/8, p_W1 = 2/8, p_W2 = 1/8, p_W3 = 2/8), d = redesign(design, p_00 = 3/8, p_W1 = 1/8, p_W2 = 3/8, p_W3 = 1/8), e = redesign(design, p_00 = 3/8, p_W1 = 1/8, p_W2 = 2/8, p_W3 = 2/8), f = redesign(design, p_00 = 3/8, p_W1 = 1/8, p_W2 = 1/8, p_W3 = 3/8) ) # Diagnose design diagnoses &lt;- diagnose_designs(designs) We see a monotonic decrease in the power as more of the sample is treated later.

(2018)) offer researchers a way to estimate the diffusion of intervention effects within some geographic or social network. Most approaches work by first cluster-assigning non-overlapping groups of individuals to treatment saturations, then block-assigning individuals to treatment in the proportions determined by the saturations. Asunka et al. (2019), for example, wanted to know if the presence of election monitors at ballot stations would displace violence and fraud to other ballot stations. They randomized constituencies to low, medium, and high levels of saturation, and then randomized ballot stations to have election monitoring or not in low, medium, or high concentrations, depending on the randomized saturation. In the original study, the authors did not include a zero-saturation condition. Here, we declare a simplified version of their design in which a zero-saturation condition is included. Main points to develop: Randomized saturation is great when you get the model right. Though, show how IPW reduces the power to detect main effect, especially if there’s no spillover. Randomized saturation assumes a model that may be wrong. In particular, spillovers are restricted to containers. But this might not be correct. 17.8.4 Design Declaration Model: Potential outcomes are defined in terms of S—the saturation—and Z—whether or not a ballot station is treated. We model spillovers in two ways. In the first, the amount of spillover that affects a unit is determined by how many other units in its network are treated. In the second, the amount of spillover a unit receives is determined by whether that unit’s geographic neighbor is treated, irrespective of whether they share a network. Inquiry: We want to know the effect of having high and medium levels of saturation versus low saturation in the control: \\(E[Y_i(Z_i = 0, S_i = \\text{high})-Y_i(Z_i = 0, S_i = \\text{low})]\\) and \\(E[Y_i(Z_i = 0, S_i = \\text{medium})-Y_i(Z_i = 0, S_i = \\text{low})]\\). We also want to know the “direct effect”–e.g. what happens to those directly treated if we disregard spillovers. Here it is defined over potential outcomes that the experiment does not reveal, since no one is treated in low-saturation constituencies: \\(E[Y_i(Z_i = 1, S_i = \\text{low})-Y_i(Z_i = 0, S_i = \\text{low})]\\). Data strategy: We assign entire groups of individual ballot stations to one of three saturations: low (0%), medium (50%), and high (75%). We then randomize individuals within groups to treatment or control in the proportions dictated by the saturation. Thus, the saturation is cluster-randomized, whereas treatment is block-randomized. Answer strategy: We weight each individual by the inverse of the probability that they find themselves in the condition they’re in. To estimate spillovers, we run one regression comparing high and one regression comparing medium to low saturation control units. To estimate the direct effect, we run a regression of the outcome on the treatment indicatior on the full sample, controlling for saturation.

["papers-with-multiple-studies.html", "18.1 Papers with multiple studies", " 18.1 Papers with multiple studies In many research projects, we seek to evaluate multiple observable implications for a single theory. [Examples: Psychology; APSR articles that have an experiment plus observational work; replication efforts.] In such cases, a single piece of evidence does not constitute sufficient evidence to validate the theory as a whole. Rather, we believe in the theory when multiple pieces of evidence support it. Conventions around what constitutes a convincing pattern of evidence vary. Some researchers will not believe a theory unless each piece of evidence in support of it is statistically significant. Less stringent approaches simply seek evidence “consistent” with the theory, such as the observation that all effects are signed in the predicted direction. Here, we declare an \\(N\\)-study design, and examine the consequences of these two different approaches to evaluating a theory in light of multiple studies. We show that, under multiple observable implications generated by the same process, conditioning on significance can lead one strongly astray. Generally speaking, looking at the sign of effects is more probative because it is much less prone to false negatives. With small numbers of studies, however, the risks of false positives are high. 18.1.1 Design Declaration Model: We declare \\(N\\) populations, all of which are governed by the same data-generating process: X is exogenous and standard normally-distributed, M is standard-normally distributed and correlated with X by rho, and Y is a function of the main effect of X as well as the interaction between X and M, with the size and sign of the direct and interactive effects determined by tau and gamma, respectively. Inquiry: We want to know, in a global sense, if our theory is “right.” Here, that means that the effect of X on Y is positive and increasing with M, and that X affects M. When tau is positive, our theory is correct. When it is zero or negative, our theory is incorrect. Data strategy: We conduct and collect independent datasets on \\(N\\) datasets of size n. In the example below, we conduct three studies, assuming we only observe X and Y in the first, only M and X in the second, and Y, M, and X, in the third. Answer strategy: Using linear regression, we estimate the bivariate correlation between X and Y in study 1, the bivariate correlation between X and M in study 2, and the interaction between X and M on Y in study 3. n1 &lt;- 100 n2 &lt;- 100 n3 &lt;- 100 rho &lt;- .5 gamma &lt;- tau &lt;- .2 generate_study_sample &lt;- function(n, rho, tau, gamma, data){ fabricate(N = n, X = rnorm(N), M = rnorm(N, X * rho, sqrt(1 - rho^2)), U = rnorm(N), Y = tau * X + gamma * M * X + U) } three_study_design &lt;- # Study 1 -- Bivariate correlation between X and Y declare_population(n = n1, tau = tau, gamma = gamma, rho = rho, handler = generate_study_sample) + declare_estimator(Y ~ X, term = &quot;X&quot;, model = lm_robust, label = &quot;Study 1&quot;) + # Study 2 -- Bivariate correlation between M and X declare_population(n = n2, tau = tau, gamma = gamma, rho = rho, handler = generate_study_sample) + declare_estimator(M ~ X, term = &quot;X&quot;, model = lm_robust, label = &quot;Study 2&quot;) + # Study 3 -- Interaction in X and M declare_population(n = n3, tau = tau, gamma = gamma, rho = rho, handler = generate_study_sample) + declare_estimator(Y ~ X + M + X:M, term = &quot;X:M&quot;, model = lm_robust, label = &quot;Study 3&quot;) 18.1.2 Takeaways Let us compare the performance of the “all significant” versus “all signed” approaches to theory confirmation when the theory is “correct” (tau and gamma positive), versus when it is “incorrect” (both parameters zero). In the first approach, a theory is deemed “supported” by the evidence when all effects are significant. In the second, the theory is supported by the evidence when the signs of all effects are positive. # Simulate design simulations &lt;- simulate_design(three_study_design) # Simulate null design null_three_study_design &lt;- redesign(three_study_design, tau = 0, gamma = 0, rho = 0) null_simulations &lt;- simulate_design(null_three_study_design) In the first three rows of the table, the theory is correct in that tau, gamma, and rho are positive, in the second three rows it is incorrect because both the main effect and interaction are zero. The “power” column tells us the proportion of simulations in which the effect is significant at the \\(\\alpha = .05\\) level, the “all significant” column tells us the proportion of simulations in which all of the studies have significant effects, the “positive” column tells us how often the study found a positively signed result, while the “all positive column” tells us the proportion of simulations where all studies had a positively signed result. tau estimator_label gamma power all_significant positive all_positive 0.2 Study 1 0.2 0.406 0.256 0.968 0.938 0.2 Study 2 0.2 0.998 0.256 1.000 0.938 0.2 Study 3 0.2 0.616 0.256 0.966 0.938 0.0 Study 1 0.0 0.058 0.000 0.500 0.114 0.0 Study 2 0.0 0.052 0.000 0.506 0.114 0.0 Study 3 0.0 0.060 0.000 0.530 0.114 Notice that, because the studies are independent, the probability that all are significant is equal to the product of their power: Pr(all studies significant) = Pr(Study 1 significant) \\(\\times\\)…\\(\\times\\) Pr(Study \\(N\\) significant). Thus, if you only believe a theory if the studies conducted to test it yield significant results, and those studies are all powered at the conventionally accepted level of 80%, you erroneously reject the theory with a probability of \\(.8^N\\). If you do three, conventionally well-powered, randomized studies each shooting at the right quantity of interest, then in almost half of the cases where you are right, you will think you are wrong. Furthermore, notice how detrimental the addition of a small study can be by this metric, even if it gets at an important mechanism. As soon as you condition your inference about the theory being correct on the significance of all the observable implications, a low-powered test can sharply increase the risk of false rejection. What can we say about the risk of false positives? The power of the individual studies is where it should be: for a stated error rate of $= $5%, the studies are every so slightly conservative. However, the “all significant” desideratum creates a rejection rate that is too high. Some of these problems, though not all, are alleviated when we disregard significance and just look at signs. When the theory is right, there is a very good chance that all of the effects we estimate are positive: we surmise the theory is correct roughly 94% of the time when it actually is. When the theory is not correct in the sense that the true effects are zero, random error means that they are positive half the time and negative the other half. Consequently, the probability of erroneously accepting the theory based on the sign of effects when the true underlying effects are zero is equal to \\(.5^N\\). Here, that means we erroneously infer we are right at a relatively high rate of 12% of simulations. In the design above, the rates at which we rejected or accepted theories seemed to depend on the number of studies we considered. In the graph below, we look at twenty-nine different \\(N\\)-study designs, all of which seek to confirm a theory by replicating evidence for it \\(N\\) times. The first design is made of two studies, each independtly evaluating the hypothesis that \\(Y\\) is positively correlated with \\(X\\). Again, we consider how conditioning an inference about the theory on whether all results are significant or all results are positive affects error rates. Again, we see that significance is not a probative way to look for observable theoretical implications. As soon as there are more than four studies, there is virtually no chance of confirming even a true theory by this metric. We see a sort of reverse multiple-comparisons problem: increasing the number of tests makes false rejections increasingly more likely when we are interested in the joint probability of all the tests saying the same thing. Unless the number of studies is small, whether all produce significant results essentially yields no information about whether the theory is correct. By contrast, looking at signs only can be highly probative. In this application, the optimal number of studies is about eight. At that point, there is virtually no chance of erroneously inferring that the theory is correct when the effects are zero, but when the theory is correct there is a good chance (almost 75%) that all of the available evidence will be signed accordingly. As the number of studies increases, so too does the probability of discordant results, and using the unanimity of signs to judge whether the theory is correct becomes increasingly unwise. "],

The metaketa design tries to solve this theoretical problem on the front end – let’s agree on what the \\(M\\) we all have in mind is (with local variations), then run a study.

["part-iii-exercises.html", "Chapter 19 Part III Exercises", " Chapter 19 Part III Exercises Measuring sensitive traits with direct questions may be biased due to sensitivity bias: subjects may perceive (rightly or wrongly) that someone such as the enumerator, their neighbors, or the authorities will impose costs on them if they provide a dispreferred answer. In sensitive settings, direct questions provide a comparatively precise answer, but they are biased. One alternative to direct questions is the list experiment (see section XXX). Under their assumptions, list experiments are unbiased, but they can be quite imprecise. Thus, the choice between list experiments and direct questions includes a bias-variance tradeoff. Following the formulas given in _____, the variance of the direct question estimator is the following, where \\(\\pi^*\\) is the true prevalence rate and \\(\\delta\\) is sensitivity bias. \\[ \\frac{1}{N - 1} \\bigg\\{ \\pi^* (1 - \\pi^*) + \\delta (1 - \\delta) - 2(\\delta - \\pi^*\\delta) \\bigg\\} \\] The variance of the list experiment is given by this expression, where \\(\\mathbb{V}(Y_i(0)\\) is the variance of the control item count and \\(\\mathrm{cov}(Y_i(0), D_i^*)\\) is the covariance of the control item count with the densitive trait. \\[ \\frac{1}{N-1} \\bigg\\{ \\pi^*(1-\\pi^*) + 4 \\mathbb{V}(Y_i(0)) + 4 \\mathrm{cov}(Y_i(0), D_i^*) \\bigg\\} \\] Our goal is to compare the direct question and list experiment designs with respect to the RMSE diagnosand. Recall that RMSE equals the square root of variance plus bias squared: \\(RMSE = \\sqrt{Variance + Bias^2}\\). Assume the following design parameters: \\(\\delta = 0.10\\), \\(\\pi^* = 0.50\\), \\(\\mathbb{V}(Y_i(0) = 0.075\\), \\(\\mathrm{cov}(Y_i(0), D_i^*) = 0.025\\). What is the RMSE of the direct question when \\(N\\) = 100? What is the RMSE of the list experiment when \\(N\\) = 100? Make a figure with \\(N\\) on the horizontal axis and RMSE on the vertical axis. Plot the RMSE for both designs over a range of sample sizes from 100 to 2000. Hint: you’ll need to write a function for each design that takes \\(N\\) as an input and returns RMSE. You can get started by filling out this starter function: direct_rmse &lt;- function(N){ # stuff goes here} How large does the sample size need to be before the list experiment is preferred to the direct question on RMSE grounds?

["research-design-lifecycle.html", "Chapter 20 Research Design Lifecycle", " Chapter 20 Research Design Lifecycle Empirical results are what we think we now know as a result of conducting a study; research design is why we think we know it. The set of reasons why a study means what we think it means – the research design itself – is of central importance throughout the entirety of the research design lifecycle, beginning with the research idea in its most embryonic form as a flash of inspiration, through the many phases of implementation, to the actual writing and publishing of the piece, and beyond, to the integration of the acquired knowledge into our collective scientific understanding of the world. At each stage of this process, your research design – your specification of \\(M\\), \\(I\\), \\(D\\), and \\(A\\) – shapes your own choices as well as how others will learn from your work. This part of the book works through each of the many discrete stages of the lifecycle. While it is necessarily presented in a linear fashion, the stages are all deeply entwined by their common connection to MIDA. For example, we show how many disputes among scholars about the proper interpretation come down to differing understandings of some part of M, I, D, or A – if your preanalysis plan is sufficiently precise about your beliefs about these features of your design, then the disputes can be specified more precisely, the better to resolve them. Not every research project will explicitly feature all of these stages. For example, prosepctive research designs like experiments and surveys often included pilot studies to learn about important unknown features of \\(M\\) before implementing the full studies.

["planning.html", "20.1 Planning", " 20.1 Planning provide your MIDA Pre-analysis plans (PAPs) are used by researchers to register a set of analyses before they learn about outcomes. PAPs clarify which choices were made before observing outcomes and which were made afterwards. Ironically, the set of decisions that should be specified in a PAP is itself remarkably unclear. PAP templates and checklists are proliferating, and the number of items they suggest range from nine to sixty. PAPs themselves are becoming longer and more detailed, with some in the American Economic Association (AEA) and Evidence in Governance and Politics (EGAP) study registries reaching hundreds of pages, as researchers seek to be ever more comprehensive. For all that, it is hard to assess whether these detailed plans actually contain key analytically-relevant details. Lot of debate about the value of PAPs (cite cite cite). Summary. Our take: these are helpful tools for researchers to plan research better; and they have a single interpretation that is useful, clarifying what the researcher was thinking at each stage. Their information signal is a function of the distance from the start of post-intervention outcome data collection. But they are useful at any stage to clarify what decisions were made when. MIDA provides a roadmap: a PAP centered around MIDA will describe the researcher’s beliefs about the world, research questions, interventions and measurement, and analysis plans informed by these other elements. The PAP can include a research design diagnosis to communicate the properties of the design as understood before seeing the results of the study, highlighting the diagnosands the researcher believed were important. – involving partners – exante vs expost power calculations – frontloading research design decisions (get more specific, identify problems) – what happens when things go wrong (not just ideal plan, but plan for how you deal with problems; SOPs) – attrition, noncompliance, study failure, missing covariate data, etc. – the properties of your design depend not only on the ideal plan but the procedure – registered reports: part of your answer strategy is how you present and writup results. registered reports are a version of preanalysis plans that include the full results-free writeup. virtue is you prespecify the whole answer strategy! you can do if-then guides to writing up. – shouldn’t just be about analysis. prespecify what you will do in D during implementation if things go wrong, this informs what we can learn. if you drop some units before random assignment (or after), will you rerandomize, add units, change sampling, etc.? this informs what we learn about the design (often expanding what we can learn by saying - if we try to treat this type of unit we won’t be able to) Benefits – Declaration can reduce ambiguities in the design. For example, a PAP that says the researchers will “use OLS with clustered standard errors” leaves out which covariates will be included and how they will be coded, whether any interactions will be estimated, and which of several common formulae will be used to calculate standard errors. By contrast, an answer strategy declared in code makes each of these choices explicit. – Design declaration can minimize the risk of fishing critiques, since the number of small decisions about modeling and constructing tables and figures that take place after data collection is substantially reduced given the ability to simulate data beforehand. – Design declaration may minimize the need for deviations. Simulating the design may reveal aspects of the design researchers were unaware of — variables they did not (yet) plan to collect, assumptions they did not know they needed to make, or planned design strategies were infeasible. The improvements come before implementation not afterwards. – Fairer replication, fairer reanalysis. Replicators lose a degree of freedom in determining what an author might have intended by a given analysis. Moreover, ex ante design diagnosis communicates the assumptions under which they thought the design was a good one before they ran the study. This makes it clearer whether a re-analysis involves an improvement in estimation strategies given a researcher’s assumptions or instead requires deviations from a researcher’s assumptions in order to to be justified. – Easier design comparison. If a design is declared at the preanalysis plan phase, then it enables direct comparison with the design as implemented in the final write-up. Side-by-side comparison of the code neatly clarifies which design choices were made ex-ante and ex-post. Side-by-side comparison of the performance of a planned and implemented designs clarify under what conditions deviations from plans are defensible improvements. The design declaration itself is a compact description of the study you want to conduct The diagnosis (and redesign process) shows why you picked the design you did. the Mock analysis section should run the actual tables and figures you plan to create using a draw of the design. ethics (summarize and cite Jay’s ideas here: http://www.jasonlyall.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/PreregisterYourEthics.pdf) ethical outcomes are potential outcomes, so we need to think about them ex ante not just on the basis of revealed outcomes SOPs 20.1.1 countering objections: Time-consuming. Yes but in our experience we only pay this cost for failed studies. Fur successful studies, nearly all work that goes in to the pap pays off in terms of higher qualtity design, literal words we already wrote, and written-in-advance analysis code. Won’t stop determined cheaters. Yes – remember that the goal is not to prevent fraud, it’s to help researchers improve their designs. Science depends on trust. Replication is better (Coffman and Niederle (2015)). These are complements, not substitutes. I can’t preregister what I will do because I don’t know what I will find. That’s fine too, just write down how you will go about “finding” things so we (and YOU) can understand your own process. 20.1.2 Other thoughts when is the right moment to write a pap? 20.1.3 citations on paps Casey, Glennerster, and Miguel (2012): early entry Olken (2015): halfway skeptical Green and Lin (2016): Standard operating procedures Christensen and Miguel (2018): review Coffman and Niederle (2015): a skeptical take (prefer replications).

["ethical-review.html", "20.2 Ethical Review", " 20.2 Ethical Review As members of society, we are all enjoined to act ethically in all areas of our lives, and the specific domain of conducting research is no different in this respect. Laws specifically govern many areas of research activity – we don’t have much to say about these legal questions except that researchers should obey the local laws. Similarly, we don’t have much to say about the governing role of institutional review boards (or IRBs). IRBs apply rules to research activity; the application of these rules is quite varied from institution to institution, and this variation can appear quite arbitrary to the individual researcher seeking IRB approval. Obtaining IRB approval is an absolute necessity for most empirical projects (even when the approval is nothing more than an affirmation that the research project is exempt from IRB oversight!). That said, the approbation of the IRB has very little to do with the ethical status of a research projects. Many unethical studies could pass IRB review and many ethical studies can run into frustrating IRB headaches. For a fascinating history of how we came to have the modern IRB, we recommend “Ethical Imperialism,” which describes how procedures that were originally designed for medical trials were applied, mostly without modification, to social scientific research studies. Instead, we conceive of the effect of research activities on the well-being of research staff, participants, and perhaps even future consumers of the research product as additional Inquiries that researchers have an ethical obligation to learn about. We discussed in the data strategy section (section ZZZ) how different data strategies may be more or less ethically encumbered. A common concern is that measurement imposes an ethical cost on subjects by wasting their time. Subjects’ time is a valuable resource – they often donate willingly to the scientific enterprise by taking a survey or similar. Sometimes their generosity is repaid with financial compensation for their time. Sometimes subjects are unknowing participants in a research study because obtaining informed consent would so distort their behavior as to hinder the ability of the researchers to study it. We discussed in the diagnosis section how expected ethical downsides can be formalized as diagnosands so that researchers can choose the best design among the “ethical” studies; or if designs can’t be discretized into ethical and non ethical, researchers can explicitly consider how much cost they are willing to impose on subjects to learn about the world. Every researcher should consider the ethical implications of the data and answer strategies for research staff and participants. Some research projects should not be conducted – the vast majority of those projects are typically weeded out well before the ethical review stage. It’s important to communicate your design choices so that they can specifically evaluate your ethical judgements. It’s difficult for others to understand (a) your design and (b) what the ethical tradeoffs truly entail. Declared designs help immensely because they focus attention on what part, exactly, people are responding to. Is it the measurement they object to? Is it the random assignment? papers to cite here: the A/B illusion (Michelle Mayer); Cite APSA guidelines; preregistering ethics guidelines (Lyall paper); report on ethics in paper (Lauren Young’s paper); Mac’s paper; Belmont report Further readings. – history: belmont report. tuskegee experiment. stanford prison experiment. – laws and IRBs: revised common rule, paper on IRBs – guidelines from econ, poli sci, soc, psych. – ethics of experiments: macartan’s paper, dawn teele’s chapter; A/B illusion; – ethics of outcome data collection: https://link.springer.com/epdf/10.1007/s11133-020-09458-9?sharing_token=ZXNJXewvrZN0ouaL02wFDPe4RwlQNchNByi7wbcMAY4-EQXsmvNo8IbQcOueStzgc77hZU2onyyln_mVDwcUpdOR-pwRaPn3QvTGa3Im4FtNdYCpNVCfjs7pObv1rfyp-y7KtLBchLUMAHPMkKVeCSMwqZH6G5ldDK9hxy4NRoQ%3D – new ideas: jay lyall paper; lauren young paper "],
["partners.html", "20.3 Partners", " 20.3 Partners Partnering with organizations in research — cooperating to intervene in the world or to measure outcomes — is increasingly common in the social sciences. Organizations can learn about how to achieve their (private) goals better by partnering with social scientists to study current programs and policies. In some cases these private goals overlap with public goods (e.g., a government learning how to expand access to healthcare), in others they are largely private (e.g., Uber learning about how to improve its revenues). Social scientists’ have their own goals: to produce knowledge and publish it. Understanding the private goals of the partner and of the researcher is essential to selecting a research design amenable to both parties. MIDA can help in doing this, by formalizing tradeoffs between the two sets of goals. One common divergence between partner and researcher goals is that partner organizations often do want to learn, but their primary mission is focused on doing. Learning how to do their work better is a goal, but it may be in the short term secondary to trying to doing the work. Donors and other constituents expect to see outputs rather than outcomes, often understandably because it is simpler to monitor the outputs of an organization (trainings held, doors knocked on) than outcomes (quality services provided, votes changed). Because of this at least short-term divergence in goals, a central tradeoff in partnering with organizations is a learning-doing tradeoff. Both researchers and organizations wish to “do” (produce outputs) and “learn” (learn how to better translate outputs into outcomes), but because of the difference in goals the weight they place on these two activities may differ. This tradeoff is commonly referred to as the exploration-exploitation tradeoff (cite), and motivates a large literature on adaptive trials that aim to directly optimize doing but in the most effective way. Research design diagnosis can help navigate the learning-doing tradeoff. One instance of the tradeoff is that the proportion of units who receive a treatment (e.g., a medicine) represents the rate of “doing” and also affects the amount of learning in that in the extreme if all units are treated there can (typically) be no learning about the effect of the treatment. The tradeoff here is represented in a graph of the RMSE vs. the proportion treated. In the absence of partners, researchers might simply ignore the proportion treated axis and select the proportion with the lowest RMSE. With a partner organization, the researcher might use this graph in conversation with the partner to jointly select the design that has the lowest RMSE that has a sufficiently high proportion treated to meet the partner’s needs to satisfy its stakeholders. Choosing the proportion treated is one example of integrating partner constraints into research designs to generate feasible designs. A second common problem is that there are a set of units that must be treated, for ethical or political reasons (e.g., the home district of a government partner must receive the treatment), or that must not be treated. If these constraints are discovered after treatment assignment, they lead to noncompliance, which may substantially complicate analysis of the experiment and even prevent providing an answer to the original inquiry. Considerable thought has been given to avoiding this type of noncompliance. Gerber and Green recommend, before randomizing treatment, exploring possible treatment assignments with the partner organization and using this exercise to elicit the set of units that must or cannot be treated. King et al. (cite) describe a ``politically-robust’’ design, which uses pair-matched block randomization and when any unit is dropped due to political constraints the pair is dropped from the study17 Design diagnosis can help in these circumstances by providing a mechanism to specify possible patterns of noncompliance and diagnosing alternative designs to mitigate the negative consequences. In addition, they can be used to communicate with partners about the consequences of noncompliance for the research to help make better decisions together about how to avoid noncompliance once treatment is randomized and the research is in progress. 20.3.1 Scattered thoughts Partnerships and ethics should be in here Research for Impact (Levine (2020)) When to walk away Advice: there’s usually a boss that gives you the green light, then staff people who actually help you. Our advice is to ensure that at least some meetings are with both the boss and the staff people so that the staff people know that the boss cares about the project and are therefore motivated to help you. A crucial person at the partner organization is the person who knows where the data are and how you can access them. Many people at partner organizations do not have this power, but you must be frequent touch. In some cases, some member of the research staff can actually embed wiht the partner organization to ensure all the good things. Involve partners in PAP writing. when should partners be coauthors on the paper? References "],
["funding.html", "20.4 Funding", " 20.4 Funding In Section XX we discuss the diagnosands related to cost. In any design, there will be a tradeoffs between diagnosands about the value of the research (in terms of RMSE or average movemenent from priors to posteriors for example) as well as costs. Cost are potential outcomes, so may vary across possible implementations of a study (e.g., when the number of treated units vary and treatment is costly), and thus diagnosing the average or maximum cost may be as important as understanding the benefits. To relax the budget constraint, researchers apply for funding. Funding applicants wish to obtain as large a grant as possible for their design, but have difficulty credibly communicating the quality of their design given the subjectivity of the exercise. Funders, on the flip side, wish to get the most value for money in the set of proposals they decide to fund, and have difficulty assessing the quality of proposed research. MIDA and design declaration provide a tool for speaking in a common language that can be more easily verified by both sides about what design is being proposed and what its value is to knowledge under a set of assumptions that can be interrogated by funders. Funding applications often aim to communicate what research design is being proposed; why learning answers from the design would be useful, important, or interesting to scholars, the public, policymakers, or another audience; how the research design provides credible answers to the question; that the researcher is capable of executing the design; and that there is value-for-money in the design and the answers it provides. A new section of funding applications that would aid in communicating about each of these questions is declaring the MIDA of the design and presenting a diagnosis of the design. In addition to common diagnosands such as bias and efficiency, two special diagnosands may be valuable: cost and, related, value-for-money. Cost can be included for each design variant as a function of design features such as sample size, the number of treated units, and the duration of survey interviews. The cost may vary by these parameters and may vary across possible designs when, for example, the number of treated units is a random number. Simulating the design across possible realizations of the design, thus, provides a distribution of costs as a function of choices the researcher makes. Value for money is a diagnosand that is a function of cost and also the amount that is learned from the design. RMSE might be one value criterion, another would be the average difference between priors and posteriors under a Bayesian answer strategy (a direct measure of learning). In some cases, funders request applicants to provide multiple options and multiple price points or to make clear how a design could be altered such that it could be funded at a lower (or higher) level. Redesigning a design with differing sample sizes would communicate how the researcher conceptualizes these options, but also provide the funder with an understanding of tradeoffs between RMSE and cost in these design variants. Applicants could use redesign to justify the high cost of their request and to ask for additional funding. Ex ante power analyses, required by an increasing number of funders, illustrate the crux of the misaligned incentives between applicants and funders. A power analysis can demonstrate almost any design is “sufficiently powered” by changing expected effect sizes and noise. – funders often request power analysis, but these are typically described in words and thus the assumptions behind them cannot be interrogated fully. (a) not in code, so not specific; (b) user power calculators that are wrong (cite paper); (c) do not provide the details funders need to verify whether they agree with the assumptions. – for funders, providing MIDA declared in code allows them to change the parameters of the design and test how the properties of the design change with beliefs about the world in M or data strategy parameters in D such as sample size, rather than having to rely on claims by applicants – often funders require regular reporting on changes in plan – MIDA and design declaration provides a way to communicate (a) what those changes are and (b) how they change the values of diagnosands. – value for money as a diagnosand (cost of each design as a function of design parameters) – allows funders to compare on a common scale (the same set of diagnosands) funding proposals – often trying to evaluate “quality” but hard to do that with narrative proposals 20.4.1 References no idea, but arnold has a document on how to prepare proposals for them.

["piloting.html", "20.5 Piloting", " 20.5 Piloting – can’t learn causal effect – what can you learn? about Y0, about M, about se – bring in blog post The designs and results of past studies are important guides for selecting M, I, D, and A. Our understanding of the nodes and edges in the causal graph of M, expected effect sizes, the distribution of outcomes, feasible randomization schemes, and many other features are directly selected from past research or chosen based on a literature review of the distribution over past studies. However, researchers face a problem in being guided by past research: the research context and our inquiries often differ in at least subtle ways from any past study. Even when we are replicating a past study, we are collecting data in a different time period and if effects vary over time then aspects of M may differ from the original study. To deal with this, we often run pilot studies. These take many forms: focus groups to learn about features of M or to learn how to ask survey questions; small-scale tests of measurement tools to verify our data collection technology works; up to mini studies with the planned design but on a smaller scale. Pilot studies are constrained by our time and by money. If we were not constrained, we would run the full study and learn what is wrong with our design and then run a corrected design for the main study. Since we cannot due to our constraints, we run either smaller mini studies or test out only a subset of the elements of our planned design. This places us in a bind: we are running a design smaller or less complete than the study we imagine conducting, and so the properties of the pilot design will not measure up. MIDA provides a framework for thinking about two aspects of piloting: what can be learned from a pilot? And what are the properties of the joint research design of pilot plus main study? Diagnosing the pilot study on its own provides stark insights, which amount to: we cannot provide answers to the inquiry in the main study, and should not try to do so. There are also aspects of the logistics of research that within time and financial constraints we simply cannot learn until we run the main study. Science is imperfect, and also iterative, but these mistakes or suboptimal design choices also often lead to discoveries. – how does it help to diagnose the design together? the properties of the main study change when we do a pilot. This is because if we run the pilot study, we are doing so to make decisions about how to run the main study, and so our design of the main study and thus its results may depend on the results (and design) of the pilot study. In this section, we illustrate several general principles that flow from diagnosing pilot studies. Purposes of pilot studies: Existence proofs: – is there variation in Y – is there variation in X – what are nodes in M – what are feasible D’s, what are feasible treatments / can you implement the treatment (existence proof) Harder questions requiring bigger sample sizes: – what is the distribution of X (helps select stratification proportions etc.) – what is the standard deviation of Y0 20.5.0.1 Assessing a pilot design declare pilot itself and diagnose just as if it were the main study if you can’t learn the answer, don’t make any decisions based on it 20.5.0.2 Assessing a sequenced design if you are making decisions about MIDA for main study based on pilot, diagnose the procedure of two studies, think about POs of pilot 20.5.0.3 Pilots and baselines Designs can be reassessed after baselines and before treatment assignment – so some of the questions you might do a pilot for can just be answered in a baseline 20.5.0.4 BLOG material Data collection is expensive, and we often only get one bite at the apple. In response, we often conduct an inexpensive (and small) pilot test to help better design the study. Pilot studies have many virtues, including practicing the logistics of data collection and improving measurement tools. But using pilots to get noisy estimates in order to determine sample sizes for scale up comes with risks. Pilot studies are often used to get a guess of the average effect size, which is then plugged into power calculators when designing the full study. The procedure is: Conduct a small pilot study (say, N = 50) Obtain an estimate of the effect size (this is noisy, but better than nothing!) Conduct a power analysis for a larger study (say, N = 500) on the basis of the estimated effect size in the pilot We show in this post that this procedure turns out to be dangerous: at common true effect sizes found in the social sciences, you are at risk of selecting an underpowered design based on the noisy effect estimate in your pilot study. A different procedure has better properties: Conduct a small pilot study (say, N = 50) Obtain an estimate of the standard deviation of the outcome variable (again, this is a noisy estimate but better than nothing!) Estimate the minimum detectable effect (MDE) for a larger study (say, N = 500), using the estimated standard deviation We show what happens in each procedure, using DeclareDesign. In each case, we’ll think about a decision the researcher wants to make based on the pilot: should I move forward with my planned study, or should I go back to the drawing board? We’ll rely on power to make that decision in the first procedure and the MDE in the second procedure. [omitting code] For each true effect size, the simulations will give us a distribution of estimated effects that a researcher might use as a basis for power analysis. For example, for a true effect size of 0 the researcher might still estimate an effect of 0.10, and so conduct their power analysis assuming that the true effect is 0.10. For each true effect, we can thus construct a distribution of power estimates a researcher might obtain from estimated effects. Since we know the true power for the true underlying effect, we can compare the distribution of post-hoc power estimates to the true power one would estimate if one knew the true effect size. What did we find? In the plot, we show our guesses for the power of the main study based on our pilot effect size estimates. At high true effect sizes (top row), we do pretty well. Most of our guesses are above 80% power, leading us to the correct decision that the study is powered. Indeed we often underestimate our power in these cases meaning that we run larger studies than we need to. However, at low true effect sizes (bottom row) we show we are equally likely to find that the design is in fact powered as underpowered. We are equally likely to guess the power of the design is 90% as 10%. There is a good chance that we will falsely infer that our design is well powered just because we happened to get a high estimate from a noisy pilot. 20.5.1 How about estimating the standard deviation of the outcome? Now, let’s look at the second approach. Here, instead of using our pilot study to estimate the effect size for a power calculation, we estimate the standard deviation of the outcome and use this to calculate the main study’s minimum detectable effect. The decision we want to make is: is this MDE small enough to be able to rule out substantively important effects? We calculate the minimum detectable effect size using the approximation from (Gelman and Hill 2006, pg. 441), 2.8 times the estimated standard error. We estimate the standard error using Equation 3.6 from (???). In summary, pilot studies can be valuable in planning research for many reasons, but power calculations based on noisy effect size estimates can be misleading. A better approach is to use the pilot to learn about the distribution of outcome variables. The variability of the outcome variable can then be plugged into MDE formulas or even power calculations with, say, the smallest effect size of political, economic, or social importance. In the same spirit, pilot studies could also be used to learn the strength of the correlation between pre-treatment covariates and the outcome variable. With this knowledge in hand, researchers can develop their expectations about how much precision there is to be gained from covariate control or blocking. References "],

["reconciliation.html", "20.7 Reconciliation", " 20.7 Reconciliation Inevitably, the research design as implemented will differ in some way from the research design as planned. When they diverge, misleading readers to believe that the design as implemented was the design as planned all along is an error. We should be transparent about how the design changed over the course of the research process – first of all, it’s the honest thing to do, and second, those changes condition how we interpret the research. Suppose the original design described a three-arm trial: one control and two treatments, but the design as implemented drops all subjects assigned to the second treatment. Sometimes this is an entirely appropriate and reasonable design modification: perhaps it turns out that due to an implementation failure, the second treatment was simply not delivered. Other times, these modification is less benign – perhaps the estimate of the effect of the second treatment does not achieve statistical significance, so the author simply omits it from the analysis. For this reason, we urge researchers to explicitly reconcile the design as planned with the design as implemented. Having a publicly-posted preanalysis plan can make the reconciliation process especially credible – we know for sure what the planned design was because the preanalysis plan describes it (in greater or lesser detail) pre-implementation. However, a preanalysis plan is not a prerequisite for engaging in reconciliation. The scientific enterprise is built in large measure on trust – we are ready to believe researchers who say, here is the design I though I would implement but due to unanticipated developements, here is the design I ended up implementing. In some cases, reconciliation will lead to additional learning beyond what can be inferred from the final design itself. When some units could refused to be included in the study sample or some units refused measurement, we learn that important features about those units. Understanding sample exclusions, noncompliance, and attrition not only may inform future research design planning choices, but contribute substantively to our understanding of the social setting. A policy implemented in the same way the study would likely also not be able to work in the units who refused to participate, and future research could examine why or how to convince them of the policy’s benefits. What belongs in a reconciliation? At a minimum, we need a full description of the planned design, a full description of the implemented design, and a list of the differences. This can be made explicit through the declaration of both design in computer code, then “diffing” the two design objects.

Introduction: Mini MIDA Theory: M, I, guesses about \\(a^M\\) Design: D, A; diagnosis under M and I. Results: \\(a^D\\) Discussion: what we learn about \\(a^M\\) and \\(M\\) from \\(a^D\\) Comments: 1. please keep kosher. Theory section material belongs in the theory section, not in the design or results section, etc. in discussion sections, often researchers talk about about future research. That’s because some inquiries are not addressed by the current MIDA, so in light of \\(a^D\\), new MIDAs can be proposed. Theory sections are for a couple of things. first they are about \\(M\\) (what are the relevant features of the model necessary to describe \\(I\\)). Second, they summarise what the previous literature has to say about \\(I\\). In particular what we think \\(a^M\\) might be. often this is just a sign. The literature review section should be aware of the MIDAs that were used to generate past \\(a^D\\)s. If they are poor (e.g., prone to bias), they should get less weight. Also should not selectively review in the sense that contrary views should also included, conditional on good MIDAs. A literature review is a “summary function” in the sense that it is a qualitative meta-analysis. That summary function should be purged of researcher bias (of course hard to know for sure) Little something here on “primacy claims” Elaborations of the basic structure. Sometimes multi-paper. They should at a minimum have the same M. Sometimes a paper is multiple ways of getting at the same I. sometimes it’s different Is.

Study 3 is pretend to learn mechanisms by which X affects Y. something here about “mixing methods” If they all have different Is, then you can’t make up for the deficiencies of one method with the strengths of the others. If they have the same Is, then perhaps we “triangulate” ? Discussion section stuff. This is where we form “posteriors”. That is, we interpret \\(a^M\\) in light of beliefs about \\(M\\). We also update about \\(M\\). for example, you might learn that an edge you (or someone) thought existed doesn’t exist. Heterogeneity teaches you about “functional form”. You might posit the existence of unmeasured but nevertheless real nodes. This might be the place where you propose new MIDAs that help you to learn about your updated M. "],
["publication.html", "20.9 Publication", " 20.9 Publication MIDA is a tool for communicating the quality of a design to reviewers and, later, readers 20.9.1 Review process Comments can come in about all four aspects of the research design. About M: please cite work that is about other edges and nodes in M. About I: the reviewers disagree that your I is “important”; they want you to write about a different I. About D: they think the sample is poor, the randomziation scheme is lame, the measurement strategy is insufficient. About A: they want logit. The goal is to respond to reviewer comments in a way that does not compromise the essential strength of your MIDA. Do not let the review process make your paper worse. You must understand how the reviewer’s comments change MIDA – do they make it stonger? if so, then adopt. Are they irrelevant to MIDA? if so, adopt. Do they actively hurt MIDA? if so, use diagnosis to demonstrate that the proposed changes would harm the research design. Idea: redesign after review, so you have a design that reflects the original design modified by reviewer requests and use diagnosis to demonstrate its (still) high quality to readers who may be skeptical of changes made during the review process that were not originally planned. 20.9.2 Publication bias Here we look at risks from publication bias and illustrate two distinct types of upwards bias that arise from a “significance filter.” A journal for publishing null results might help, but the results in there are also likely to be biased, downwards. Two distinct problems arise if only significant results are published: The results of published studies will be biased towards larger magnitudes. The published studies will be unrepresentative of the distribution of true effects in the relevant population of studies. These two problems are quite distinct. The first problem is more familiar: conditional on any true effect size, larger estimates have an easier time passing the statistical significance filter, so the distribution of published results will be biased upwards because it will be missing all of the smaller estimates. The second problem is more subtle. If different studies seek to measure effects that are of different size, conditioning on statistical significance means that we are more likely to learn from places that have large effects than from places that have small effects. The significance filter means that our answers to any particular question will be biased and it means that the set of questions we see answers to will be biased as well. The Journal of Significant Results is a poor guide to the true distribution of causal effects. What about a Journal of Null Results? Such a journal would condition acceptance on failing to achieve statistical significance. The set of articles published in such a journal would also be biased. Looking first at the Journal of Significant Results, we see the familiar problem: the average estimate is biased away from the true value of the estimand. This problem is greatly helped by increasing the sample size. But we can also see the second problem – the distribution of estimands (the true effects under study) is also biased towards larger effects, this problem is also allayed, though less dramatically, by larger sample sizes. The Journal of Null Results suffers from a parallel problem, only in reverse. Now estimands are smaller than is typical in the population and, on average, estimates are biased down relative to these estimands. Strikingly, the bias in estimand selection is worse at the larger sample size (though downwards bias within the set of published studies is smaller). Now, we agree that proactively publishing null results may help when considering entire research literatures as a whole, and for this reason alone a Journal of Null Results is probably a good thing. But, better would be to not do any conditioning at all. The Journal of Interesting Designs would condition only on the question being interesting and the design being appropriate to answering the question. We see that the distribution of estimates and estimands are both centered on the correct average value. Idea of results-blind review Idea of registered reports "],
["archiving.html", "20.10 Archiving", " 20.10 Archiving One of the biggest successes in the push for greater research transparency has been changing norms surrounding the sharing of data and analysis code after studies have been published. It has been become de rigeur at many journals to post these materials at publicly-available respositories like the OSF or dataverse. This development is undoubtedly a good thing. In older manuscripts, sometimes data or analyses are described as being “available upon request” but of course such requests are sometimes ignored. Furthermore, a century from now, study authors will no longer be with us even if they wanted to respond to such requests. Public respositories have a much better chance of preserving study information for the future. What is in the typical replication archive. First, the data \\(d\\) itself. Sometimes this is the raw data, sometimes it is only the “cleaned” data that is actually called by analysis scripts. Where ethicially possible, we think it is probably better to post as much of the raw data as possible alongside a cleaning script that ingests the raw data and outputs the cleaned data. Cleaning scripts might be considered a part of the data strategy \\(D\\) in the sense that they complete the measurement procedures laid out in \\(D\\). They might also be considered part of the answer strategy in the sense that they apply an interpretation to the data provided by the world. We do not take a hard stance on whether data cleaning procedures rightly belong in \\(D\\) or \\(A\\) since the choice likely varies from study to study. Replication archives also include \\(A\\), the set of fucntions applied to \\(d\\) that produce \\(a^D\\). It is vitally important that the actual analysis code is archived because the natural-language descriptions of \\(A\\) that are typically given in papers are imprecise. As a small example, many articles describe their answer strategies as “ordinary least squares” but do not fully describe the set of covariates used or what flavor of standard errors were estimated. The actual analysis code makes \\(A\\) explicit. While typical replication archives include \\(d\\) and \\(A\\), we think that future replication archives should also include a design declaration that fully describes \\(M\\), \\(I\\), \\(D\\), and \\(A\\) – that is, we should archive designs, not just data and analysis code. This should be done in code and words. In addition, a diagnosis should be included, demonstrating the properties as understood by the author and also indicating the diagnosands that the author considered in judging the quality of the design.

["reanalysis.html", "20.11 Reanalysis", " 20.11 Reanalysis The crucial thing about a reanalysis is that \\(d\\) is fixed. You can bring new \\(M\\)’s \\(I\\)’s and \\(A\\)s to bear, but the revealed data is fixed. how do we update from the reanalysis research design (the original design plus the reanalysis of d)? – the design is the research design from before with two sets of estimates from two different A’s – need an aggregation function (decisionmaking function) that converts the two sets of results into a decision or posterior A is constrained: it must follow from the D of the study, which cannot be changed because the study was run already. what can be learned from reanalysis? (1) confirm there were not errors (consider changing A only) (2) reassess what is known about the same inquiry, using new information about the world (change M, change A to suit new M) (3) learn something new from the data about another node or edge or a different summary about the same ones (change I and possibly A to match it; possibly M if a node was missing; possibly add data) (4) assess “robustness” of findings - point to discussion of this in answer strategy (or move it here) (change A) (5) update M based on new research and assess what d can tell us from this study (change M and possibly I, possibly A to fit changed M and I) how can we assess the properties of a reanalysis? diagnose changed MIDA. important to not condition on d, the design includes the actual D, and we need to consider what results d’ we would get from the reanalysis under different realizations of D. there are now two A’s, so need to specify a decision function about how to integrate the two findings. this could be throw away the old a, or combine them in some way. if it’s a “robustness” to alternative A, then you may want to combine not throw out for example. it’s crucial to specify how you do that, that’s part of the answer strategy. 20.11.1 Citations to incorporate Clemens (2017) on taxonomy of these kinds of efforts References "],
["replication.html", "20.12 Replication", " 20.12 Replication After your study is completed, it may one day be replicated. Replication differs from reanalysis in that a replication study involves the specification of a new MIDA and collection of new data. As discussed in the previous, a reanalysis may re-specify parts of the research design, but always re-uses the original data \\(d\\) in some way. So-called “exact” replications hold key features of I, D, and A fixed, but draw a new dataset \\(d_{new}\\) from \\(D()\\) and apply the same \\(A\\) to the new \\(d\\) in order to produce a fresh answer \\(a_{new}^D\\). Replications are said to “succeed” when \\(a_{old}^D\\) and \\(a_{new}^D\\) are similar and to “fail” when they are not. Dichotomizing replication attempts into successes and failures is usually not that helpful, and it would be better to simply characterize how similar \\(a_{old}^D\\) and \\(a_{new}^D\\) are. Of course, exact replication is impossible: at least some elements of M have changed between the first study and the replication. Specifying how they might have changed, e.g., how outcomes vary with time, will help judge differences observed between \\(a_{old}^D\\) and \\(a_{new}^D\\). Statistical noise will also play a role. Replication studies benefit enormously from the knowledge gains produced by the original studies. For example, we learn a large amount about \\(M\\) and the likely value of \\(a^M\\) from the original study. The \\(M\\) of the replication study can and should incorportate this new information. For example, if we learn from the original study that \\(a^M\\) is positive but it might be small, the replication study could respond by changing \\(D\\) in order to increase the sample size. This is the intuition behind the “small telescopes” paper, which offers a rule of thumb for how much larger replication studies should be than original studies. We think this rule of thumb is useful, though design diagnosis and redesign is an even better way to learn about how to change the design of the replication study in light of the original study. When designing original studies, you should anticipate that someday your work will be replicated. This improves your ex ante incentives. To the extent that you want future replication studies to arrive a similar answers to the original study you produce (i.e., you want their \\(a_{new}^D\\) to match your \\(a_{old}^D\\) as closely as possible), you will want to choose designs that bring \\(a_{old}^D\\) as close to \\(a^M\\) as possible, under the presupposition that faithful replicators will also design their studies in such a way that \\(a_{new}^D\\) will also be close to \\(a^M\\). Replication studies necessarily differ from original studies – it is literally impossible to reproduce the exact conditions of the original study in the same way it’s impossible to step in the same river twice. Another way of putting that same statment is that \\(D_{new}\\) is necessarily different from \\(D_{old}\\). Theory (i.e., beliefs about \\(M\\)) is the tool we use to say that \\(D_{old}\\) is similar enough to \\(D_{new}\\) to consititute a close enough replication study. As a concrete example, many survey experimental replications involve using the exact same experimental stimuli but changing the study sample, e.g., from a nationally representative sample to a convenience sample. So-called “conceptual” replications alter both \\(M\\) and \\(D\\), but keep \\(I\\) and \\(A\\) as similar as possible. That is, a conceptual replication tries to ascertain whether a relationship in one context (\\(I(M_{old})\\)) also holds in a new context (\\(I(M_{new}\\)). The trouble and promise of conceptual replications lies in the success of the designer at holding \\(I\\) constant. Too often, a conceptual replication fails because in changing \\(M\\), too much changes about \\(I\\) such that too much changes about the “concept” under replication. There should be a summary function for how to interpret the difference between \\(a_{old}^D\\) and \\(a_{new}^D\\). This may be take the new one and throw out the old if MIDA was poor in the first. It may be taking the average. It may be a precision-weighted average. Specifying this function ex ante may be useful, to avoid the choice of summary depending on the results of the replication. This summary function will be reflected in A and in the discussion section of the replication paper. "],
["resolving-disputes.html", "20.13 Resolving Disputes", " 20.13 Resolving Disputes The problem: Acrimonious debates arise; Hard to interpret contribution of replication and reanalysis; First main task (accumulation of knowledge) damaged. The solution: Some of this comes down to basic disagreements we can’t resolve. But some of it comes down to a lack of principles guiding how design decisions are made and how the results they produce should be interpreted. And a lack of procedures for understanding the consequences of decisions. Principles for making design choices, tailored to the distinct challenges posed to reanalysis and to replication Some changes are justifiable / encouraged, some things are not justifiable / discouraged, conditions for justification are clarified Procedures for putting principles into practice Declaration and diagnosis through DD Current practice for replication is to exactly replicate data strategy and analysis strategy in new or same context. This is not needed! Standard should be: best answer to same inquiry in new or same context! But how can we justify changes to D and A that give a “better” answer to same inquiry? Replacing them with alternative practices justified by design simulation 1. M always changes! (you have more information on tau or sd(tau)) 2. Home ground dominance: Change A or D-and-A if A’ &gt; A under M 3. Robustness to alternative models: Change A or D-and-A if A’ ≥ A under M AND A’ &gt; A under M’ E.g. change from simple to complete RA 4. Model plausibility:If A’ &lt; A under M AND A’ &gt; A under M’, then change to A’ or D-and-A IFF M’ is more plausible than M E.g. switching to balanced design if you believe variances equal across treatment groups 5. Undefined inquiries. Change I to I’ if I is undefined under M If I is defined under M: You can’t change to I’, You can’t change D to D’ if that means I unidentifiable. Disorganized thoughts: - Changes to D include both interventions (sampling and randomization), as well as the inclusion of different / new datasets on the same model (this is common in econ reanalyses at state-level). The collection of “different” data through a change in question wording also fits into this. Need to think about a good typology of data strategies. - There’s often a broader research question that’s being answered, and when I changes sometimes both are answering the same broader question. But focuses debate on whether that claim is true that I and I’ answer the same broader I. - In replication can you use data from study 1 to assess the plausibility of M? - When does changing outcomes change the inquiry? Example: you used z-scores in your original analysis in order to measure an effect on five different measures of some latent construct. I show that taking a simple average has better properties (e.g., statistical power), and use this instead of z-score. Have I changed estimand? If so, are there any instances of “recoding” or even “rewording” of outcome measures that we would be OK with, insofar as they get better answers to the inquiry without changing the inquiry? One way of looking at this: inquiry is in reference to summary of a latent variable, which stays constant, but D changes which is different measurement of the latent variable Point to keep in mind from this: D change might be in sampling/treat assignment or measurement Key thing we are saying here: there are two dimensions of change with measurement. (1) are you changing estimands because the latent construct is changing implicitly; (2) are you changing to a better/worse measurement of the same latent construct. 20.13.1 Example policing Knox, Lowe, and Mummolo (2020) (https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/american-political-science-review/article/administrative-records-mask-racially-biased-policing/66BC0F9998543868BB20F241796B79B8) study the statistical biases that accompany estimates of racial bias in police use of force when presence in the dataset (being stopped by police) is conditioned on an outcome that is a downstream consequence of race. They show the estimate is not identified unless additional modelling assumptions are brought to bear. Gaebler et al. (2020) (https://5harad.com/papers/post-treatment-bias.pdf) study the same question and make such modeling assumptions (subset ignorability, definition 2). In a twitter thread (https://twitter.com/jonmummolo/status/1275790509647241222?s=20), Mummolo shows the three DAGs that are compatible with subset ignorability. We agree with Mummolo that these DAGs assume away causal paths that are very plausible. This document provides a design declaration for this setting and shows how estimates of the controlled direct effect (effect of race on force among the stopped) are biased unless those paths are set to zero by assumption. Design Declaration There are four variables: (D: minority, M: stop, U: suspicion (unobserved), Y: force) and five paths: D_M = 1 # effect of minority on stop U_M = 1 # effect of suspicion on stop D_Y = 1 # effect of minority on force U_Y = 1 # effect of suspicion on force M_Y = 1 # effect of stop on force This basic design allows all five paths. design_1 &lt;- declare_population(N = 1000, D = rbinom(N, size = 1, prob = 0.5), U = rnorm(N)) + declare_potential_outcomes(M ~ rbinom(N, size = 1, prob = pnorm(D_M * D + U_M * U)), assignment_variable = &quot;D&quot;) + declare_reveal(M, D) + declare_potential_outcomes(Y ~ rnorm(N, D_Y * D + M_Y * M + U_Y * U), conditions = list(D = c(0, 1), M = c(0, 1))) + declare_reveal(outcome_variables = &quot;Y&quot;, assignment_variables = c(&quot;D&quot;, &quot;M&quot;)) + declare_estimand(CDE = mean(Y_D_1_M_1 - Y_D_0_M_1)) + declare_estimator(Y ~ D, subset = M == 1, estimand = &quot;CDE&quot;) We redesign the design 3 times, removing one path at a time, then simulate all four designs. # no effect of D on M design_2 &lt;- redesign(design_1, D_M = 0) # no effect of U on M design_3 &lt;- redesign(design_1, U_M = 0) # no effect of U on Y design_4 &lt;- redesign(design_1, U_Y = 0) This chunk is set to echo = TRUE and eval = do_diagnosis simulations &lt;- simulate_designs(design_1, design_2, design_3, design_4, sims = sims) Right after you do simulations, you want to save the simulations rds. This plot confirms that unless one of those implausible assumptions hold, estimates of the CDE are biased. "],
["synthesis.html", "20.14 Synthesis", " 20.14 Synthesis One of the last, if not the last, stage of the lifecyle of a research design is its eventual incorportation in to our common scientific understanding of the world. Research findings about specific Is – specific \\(a^D\\)s need to be synthesized into our broader scientific understanding. Research synthesis takes two basic forms. The first is meta-analysis, in which a series of \\(a^D\\)s are analyzed together in order to better understand features of the distribution of answers obtained in the literature. Traditional meta-analysis typically focuses on the average of k answers: \\(a_1^D\\),\\(a_2^D\\),…\\(a_k^D\\). Studies can be averaged together in many ways that are better and worse. Sometimes the answers are averaged together according to their precision – a precision weighted average of estimates from many studies is equivalent to fixed-effects meta analysis. Sometimes studies are “averaged” by counting up how many of the estimates are positive and significant, how many are negative and significant, and how many are null. This is the typical averaging approach taken in a literature review. Regardless of the averaging approach, the goal of this kind of synthesis is to learn as much as possible about a particular \\(I\\) by drawing on evidence from many studies. A second kind of synthesis is an attempt to bring together many \\(a^D\\), each of which targets a different Inquiry about a common Model. This is the kind of synthesis that takes place across an entire research literature. Different scholars focus on different nodes and edges of the common model, so a synthesis needs to incorporate the diverse sources of evidence. How can you best anticipate how your research findings will be synthesized? For the first kind of synthesis – meta analysis – you must be cognizant of keeping a commonly understood \\(I\\) in mind. You want to select inquiries not for their novelty, but because of their commonly-understood importance. We want many studies on the effects of having women versus men elected officials on public goods because we want to understand this particular \\(I\\) in great detail and specificity. While the specifics of the models \\(M\\) might differ from study to study, the fact that the \\(I\\)s are all similar enough to be synthesized allows for a specific kind of knowledge accumulation. For the second kind of synthesis – literature-wide progress on a full causal model – even greater care is required. Specific studies cannot make up bespoke models \\(M\\) but instead must understand how the specific \\(M\\) adopted in the study is a specical case of some master \\(M\\) that is in principle agreed to by a wider research community. The nonstop, neverending proliferation of study-specific theories is a threat to this kind of knowledge accumulation. (Cite cyrus on causal empiricism, that psych paper on crazy proliferation of theories). A research synthesis is a “meta MIDA” M: A master Model that subsumes portions of the sub Ms? I: This is a summary of all of the Is across the stueis. D: This is the inclusion / exclusion criteria. Transformations of the study data. standardization. (sampling, measurement.) A: things like Random effects, fixed effects, Quimpo. \\(I_1 \\approx I_2 \\approx I_3\\) Not \\(a^M_1 \\approx a^M_2 \\approx a^M_3\\) Meta-analysis can be used not just to guess about effects out-of-sample but also to re-evaluate effects in sample: https://declaredesign.org/blog/2018-12-11-meta-analysis.html "],
